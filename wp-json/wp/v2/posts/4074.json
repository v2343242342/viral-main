Think again. Mastering social media is an art and can take years to reach expert level. And, like many things, the more you learn about the platforms, the more you realize how little you know.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But maybe you don\u2019t have the budget to hire a team right now. We get it. However, there are ways for you to quickly and easily up your social media game with these social media tips.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>1. \u00a0 Use this picture, not that one.\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/mOjiZjWCoDJSCVvM1nMNyTd2I0sUVXzB2i9CIGRypF9C5rqbXZzzKo1Mv-GbS2Vh6VOLKNX87zsf9gODp8aZB9iKX859hPbbnESy3WBGsikcOcZNF4NbkO3kbfb4AXl90qJPMYny\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No one can truly define what \u201cthumb-stopping\u201d content looks like. Sure, you can probably easily tell what is more engaging when given a side-by-side, but a manual on what will garner the most engagement just doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, a rule of thumb that we have learned after running hundreds of campaigns for clients is to <strong>choose images with people looking straight through the screen<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have a look at the images below. All were used side-by-side in real campaigns for our clients.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the first set of images, the goal we wanted to depict in the image is clear: family. But the image with the subjects looking straight at the camera performed far better, when the only variable in the campaign was the image.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Cost per link click\u00a0<\/td>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Cost per link click<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$6.25<\/td>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$0.73<strong> &#x2b07;$5.52<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/27F8k12P8uezshE-oteUGPOBtOLQLqc8-CCMx9naCnObNguMrz-qwGsy9pjh8dKdYCkOJdrrvgFIxE95TUlBtLAQGFspfNprK4p5DuhWrWEkzNwgX0w4y2d3Cxyk37IE4HaO0pe-\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have a look at some other images from a different campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Cost per landing page view<\/td>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Cost per landing page view\u00a0<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$4.17<\/td>\r\n<td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">$3.65 &#x2b07;<strong>$0.52<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/6iSixZWZYCxCtmSYRII_qzP710tS9RDjNc9jpjR4ShkVQd8XmwQIscutCNq9RR6aKOw2JgrMbJiW_Tgc9EoxARiQgWI3vHJbMW-_QEBZrV9Q7qW4u6bJtMryi2mEZkpgzs_pl2gs\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The results speak for themselves, and they are especially powerful for <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilemonkey.com\/blog\/instagram-for-business-in-2020\">platforms like Instagram<\/a>.

And remember that whatever your brand, whatever your product &#8211; people want to connect to other people.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>2. Invite those likers<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You don\u2019t necessarily have to spend money on a page like campaign to grow your audience. Nor do you have to post content constantly with the intent of having your page following grow incrementally.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It may not work as quickly as a page like campaign, but a quick hack is to invite the users who are engaging with your content to like your page.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Head to a piece of content that has received good engagement.\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<li>Click the reactions number.<\/li>\r\n<li>Scroll down and invite the users who have an \u2018Invite\u2019 button next to their name.\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Vouila!

Drill down your target audience<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/how-we-grew-trupanions-veterinary-social-media-community\/\">If you\u2019re using Facebook Ads Manager<\/a>, this is a tip for you! If you\u2019re still running ads through \u2018Ads Centre\u2019, maybe this will convince you that you need a heavier duty program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook Ads Manager is not for the faint of heart. It\u2019s convoluted and not very user friendly. But once you learn your way around, it\u2019s a bit like Photoshop. The possibilities are endless.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, when you\u2019re creating an audience, you would have noticed the \u2018Detailed Targeting\u2019 section. This is where you narrow down your audience from the entire region you\u2019re targeting to people who have specific interests. Have you also noticed the little buttons underneath &#8211; \u2018Exclude People\u2019 and \u2018Narrow Audience\u2019?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is where things get fun, and specific!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Using exclusions<\/h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have an insurance business. You offer home insurance, but you don\u2019t offer life insurance. If you just put \u2018Home Insurance\u2019 into the interest (detailed) targeting, you\u2019ll have a broad audience and may grab peoples\u2019 attention who are also interested in life insurance services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/w73eNEBkfyVnC9iToLrda5Flj_PMEEbY1FAGYDZAbrHEtiTmb2hZoYGohzOZwNC6DBE5gLGUtn-GKPiiOrl2ayQrPC18OsOqn9m2YElGFxmn0lT26Gr8McOpFq-afpvB4FYNFV_x\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"214\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How do you avoid this?

Let&#8217;s say, for instance, you have a company that sells headphones, but they\u2019re only available to users with iPhone 7\u2019s. You want to make sure you\u2019re not spending money delivering ads to users who would be unable to use your product. To do this, we will use the \u2018Narrow Audience\u2019 option.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s start with targeting users who are interested in headphones.\u00a0Check out the size of the audience.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/zYbQ6_T5Ef47H5O_HxwnFNHc2GvPcuBJu9KUtNv7DpVlf50PzCgNotLW_kcxpmBdHbSbj37k3OpzMhv7kuRNDqcoGO9K6jVUue0fNNKWQFa2C-V9RmyBXSPMqq61P2QorKk-3W_t\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"258\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now let\u2019s see how the pool of users reduces when we narrow our audience.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/aeQXSMM7zKL_SHSFLAiVQ0tnkVxybSeR_BYJll9lRL7zgvEp469L6xDUH2IrVnR1svWf8kX95bliufvYeSnzhs4LJBgLnaY8KCsWf7NHMAqYvL3Mj4nj8xg99psDVKF95gr4Kyga\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"308\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of paying to reach 34,000,000 people who may or may not be interested in the product you\u2019re selling, we can narrow down the audience to ensure our ads are only reaching the eyes that we want to.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>4. Give your page some love<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have a look at your Facebook page as if you were one of your customers. Is it cohesive? Can you quickly find what you need? Does it look good? Well-branded?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Be brutally honest with yourself. If it could look better, invest the time. Remember that more and more people are turning to Facebook over websites for information on a business. As such, you want to put your best foot forward from the get-go.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some quick ways to better your page\u2019s aesthetic:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Add a new cover photo slideshow<\/h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Making videos can be time consuming. However, there is an easy way to bypass creating a cover video while achieving a similar effect: slideshows. You add a few photos and BOOM! You\u2019ve got a showcase of your business and offering. If you don\u2019t have any high quality photos of your own, check out sites like Unsplash or Pexels for free stock imagery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Edit your side tabs<\/h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that those tabs on the side: \u2018Home\u2019, \u2018Services\u2019, \u2018Reviews\u2019 etc. are able to be edited? You can chop and change and add in sections that are more relevant to your business.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Go to your page &gt; Settings &gt; Templates and Tabs\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once there, scroll down to the bottom and hit \u2018Add\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/_EDhSdxGt6-F-aRG4gFqO3Ou4vi5da8i5gP5_e07rWuN2-GE58eyxorxU40FIJ6aGAh8S4foXhYNmTQ1sYbkloMPYjPXfnlCmS81XfJwkw2KpqEXy3yRCGyl4ISuhiLVrJGSgMha\" alt=\"\" width=\"395\" height=\"252\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can also drag and drop where you would like each service to appear on the left hand sidebar.

There is section called \u2018Our Story\u2019 in the right hand column of your Facebook page.

Put up a photo of your team, your office building or a culture event. People want to know that they are connecting to other people, and this is a great way to show them that they are.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>5. Try, test, and try again<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This one is for you, Facebook Ads Manager users. Think you know your target audience? Think again. Too often, business owners narrow their audience far too early. As a result, they continually run into high cost per results. To avoid this falling into this trap, split test, split test, split test.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When creating your campaign in Facebook Ads Manager, you are able to select one objective. Next, you are prompted to create an ad set. This is where you choose your placement, audience and delivery schedule. So, if you want to test a few different audiences\u2026 create a few different ad sets.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have a look at the below campaign for one of our clients. The objective of the campaign is link clicks and the intended audience is senior citizens interested in home care. However, in order to achieve the lowest cost per result, we didn\u2019t make too many assumptions about our audience and split tested three different audiences.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Check out which one is performing best.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/b1w4udr7dWoBQbd2lLLoFUUueff1kt1QvUW8Zs84Rb76OLo9sF91U0LRlrAoV3P1WvbQmwXMm2q5IFLBoTQ39E5EDormI2S_cPbleOmlvwjlhLEc8adznXJzoLWMeYRgdB13bJ04\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"176\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Try, test, and try again. <\/strong>You may be surprised at who is engaging with your content.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media isn\u2019t easy and managing your page and your ads takes time and expertise.
