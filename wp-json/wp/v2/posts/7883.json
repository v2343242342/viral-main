For most businesses, though, Facebook should still be a key part of your marketing plan.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure why Facebook is so important or why you should be using it? Listed below are 8 Facebook statistics that every business owner needs to know in 2021.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Facebook Has Billions of Users<\/h2>\n<p>Over <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.fb.com\/investor-news\/press-release-details\/2021\/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results\/default.aspx\">2.80 billion<\/a> people use Facebook each month. Approximately 1.84 billion people visit the site daily, too. This means you have lots of opportunities to expand your brand awareness and attract new customers.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Facebook Is Still a Social Media Leader<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook is the world\u2019s leading social platform. It reaches <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/social-networks-experienced-pandemic-driven-boost-2020\">59 percent<\/a> of social media users. It\u2019s no wonder most social media agency experts recommend using Facebook!<\/p>\n<h2>3. Millions of Businesses Use Facebook<\/h2>\n<p>Over <a href=\"https:\/\/s21.q4cdn.com\/399680738\/files\/doc_financials\/2020\/q4\/FB-Q4-2020-Conference-Call-Transcript.pdf\">200 million<\/a> small businesses throughout the world use Facebook\u2019s marketing tools. There\u2019s a good chance your competitors are using them, so you ought to consider it, too.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Facebook Is Great for Reaching the 35-54 Year Old Market<\/h2>\n<p>Approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edisonresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/The-Infinite-Dial-2020-from-Edison-Research-and-Triton-Digital.pdf\">74 percent<\/a> of U.S.-based Facebook users fall between 35 and 54 years of age.

Most Facebook Users Access it Via Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>Nearly all Facebook users (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/377808\/distribution-of-facebook-users-by-device\/\">98.3 percent<\/a>) access the social media platform via a mobile device. This is essential information for marketers who are creating ads and posts promoting their business. If your content isn\u2019t visible on people\u2019s mobile devices, you\u2019re not going to see the kind of results you\u2019re after.<\/p>\n<h2>6. More People Share Content Through Facebook Than Other Platforms<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to sharing content (articles, news stories, infographics, etc.) with others, Facebook beats other social media platforms. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/200843\/social-media-activities-by-platform-usa\/\">Fifty-seven percent<\/a> of users use Facebook to share content, compared to 46 percent of Snapchat users, 45 percent of Instagram users, and 32 percent of Twitter users.<\/p>\n<h2>7.
