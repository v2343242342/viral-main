It is one of the eight <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uniformed_services_of_the_United_States\">U.S. uniformed services<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">THE GOAL<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The United States Air Force seeks to educate new audiences on the opportunities that exist within USAF employment. In addition to educating new audiences, the USAF would like to garner more leads through social media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, the USAF would like to garner qualified leads who intend to book an appointment with a recruiting agent. Content and ads will be deployed from a main Pacific Northwest Facebook page, but will be made available for individual agents to utilize across their professional pages.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CONTENT STRATEGY<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4671\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-4-1024x659.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our content strategy had three main areas that needed to be focused on, education, Air Force culture, and recruitment. With all three of the areas just mentioned our goal was to create eye-catching visuals that would appeal to our main demographic which is young men and women between the ages of 18-27. After many conversations with our client, we were able to create a mix of still images, short videos, and animated posts that met their branding standards, and the aesthetic they were looking for.\u00a0 After three months we have seen an increase in organic traffic and engagement on Instagram and Facebook.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">THE AD STRATEGY<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the goals in mind, we set out to create a strategy that would be able to accomplish the above goals effectively. For this particular strategy, it was important we had a deep understanding of Facebook\u2019s advertising guidelines for employment ads. Ads can often be rejected and this can eventually lead to a suspension of the ad account. With this in mind, we collaborated with the client and carefully worded ads in order to pass Facebook\u2019s review process. In order to achieve leads for the Air Force, we utilized an engagement, traffic and lead generation campaign. It was important for us to not simply allocate funds into a lead generation campaign, but to generate engagement and traffic as well which contributes to social proof.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">THE AD RESULTS<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Engagement<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/c432KooJMKpR0_QSeeX-MNdztkF-qNNn3vbOpurobvPvll5st2mUfvFVhE5gktRBEAEX4zq0EDurl7RwHs8z3JGrFcN4xOfjP5PJExA5SwPiihp8lLexbbjsgy82Nq_pAJ-BTPGo\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4668\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-1-1024x356.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For our engagement campaign, we achieved over 12k engagements in just 5 months and the cost per engagement averaged at just $0.04. On the posts that were put into the engagement campaign, we also added a button with a link that led to the lead form on the landing page. This allowed users to not only engage with the content, but to fill out the lead form if they were interested in recruitment.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Traffic<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/IOb07DA1bIVdRySWTg9-F602br9B3vzxAKflBhROyiqOLhLUXsk9JGKM6CvEe14KC-xqbd3vevVo8Bk-wvLVdH7NhR3JAhxAQFqAZHaeV0I3rgRgHAmvBls-gA9llsl1e-ElMktw\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4669\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-2-1024x356.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For our traffic campaign, we focused on getting traffic to the landing page which included a lead form. Typically, link clicks cost around $1.00 each. We were excited to achieve an average cost per link click of $0.65. In total, we achieved 134 link clicks and from this we were able to create a warm website retargeting audience to use.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lead Generation<\/strong><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/NRHfXqeKTpvQBThczN9fQVAdi2Gj1vQy7PnhQxwfZZYZd3MgzeV874me7pNrzzbAbVIz8ZYgtmmi01O6p7gNHVi4Madwni6QKoJpSFD-npBjIFxp9IO-7sfaQLHLnXEn8HQdaP-G\" width=\"624\" height=\"296\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4667\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-1024x320.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The above results are for the lead generation campaign that led to the landing page. This is where users would fill out their information. We achieved 134 leads total at a cost per lead of just $7.24. The KPI per lead is roughly $50.00 each so this is a phenomenal result.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We also ran on-Facebook lead generation campaigns where the user would fill out their information on Facebook. Both of the lead generation campaigns fluctuated in cost per result, so we found it helpful to split test the efficacy of both simultaneously. For the on-Facebook lead generation campaign, we achieved 76 leads at a cost per lead on average of just $28.63.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/hijG3PTao0DaGZ9686mzGkLiJCvCRFqwqcw1s5QbgzCzNdCRg-J-7bqJFX04YOjiePE_Cuznj0t5GaiwRf7koFfqovO5vBjQpuo9KGI9omEPF6QHZ_xV7clDeISbiEk8y9xF3kd4\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4670\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/image-3-1024x356.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With our paid media driving such effective and desirable results, we have been able to increase traffic to the website, engage our audiences and generate high quality leads.
