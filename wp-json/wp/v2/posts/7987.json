For reference, we are sitting among other winners such as Bank of America and WWE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To say we are proud of our team and this accomplishment is the understatement of the year. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.communicatorawards.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Communicator Awards<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the leading international creative awards program<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">honoring creative excellence for communication professionals. This is an annual competition honoring the best in advertising, corporate communications, public relations and identity work for print, video, interactive and audio. We were among over 5,000 entries from ad agencies, interactive agencies, production firms, in-house creative professionals, graphic designers, design firms, and public relations firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To see our winning entry, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1zItg_fC_P8injbBVrr96KyvYgVb4_KQq\/view?usp=sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We would strongly recommend checking out the entry via the above link. For a brief summary, see below:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>The Client<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The client is a film marketing company called The Arsonist. They primarily focus on marketing indie films and specialize in building strong awareness, growing audiences and enhancing investor returns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Brief<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were tasked with increasing leads for their film marketing firm. The target market was indie film producers and directors who have a funded film ready to go to market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>The Campaign<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the brief in mind, we decided to run our campaign across Facebook and Instagram for 10 days, optimizing for conversions. The conversion in this case was a lead form on the client&#8217;s website that asked for basic contact information. The submission of this form counted as a conversion within our ad campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The targeting used in this ad campaign included A\/B tests between film distributors, indie film festival interests, indie film sites interests and website user retargeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creative used in this campaign was sleek, well-branded graphics that provided further clarity on the offerings of the clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>The Results<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, we achieved 61 leads. The best performing audience was targeting users interested in specific indie film sites. This audience achieved 38 leads out of the total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average cost per lead was $6.02. Given the specificity of the target audience, this\u00a0 result is phenomenal to see and indicates appropriate targeting and creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the leads achieved, we also saw a click through rate of 1.73% resulting in over 350 landing page views. These will be implemented into a future website retargeting campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average time users saw an ad within this campaign was 1.60. This is important because it indicates users understood and became interested in the offering almost immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you like our team to create an award-winning campaign for your business? <a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/contact\/\">Contact us<\/a> today!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Stoked.
