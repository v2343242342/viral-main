It\u2019s not just the place you haphazardly toss your resume up onto when you\u2019re looking for a new job, nor is it the professional equivalent of Facebook. You definitely\u00a0<em>can<\/em> and\u00a0<em>should<\/em> use LinkedIn for that nowadays, yes, but the real focus is on social selling: promoting your personal brand and establishing yourself as an expert in your field.<\/p>\n<p>That phrasing may sound intimidatingly grandiose, but it really isn\u2019t. \u00a0In fact, outside of actually <strong><em>filling in<\/em><\/strong> your LinkedIn profile, everything else you can do to improve your presence on LinkedIn comes down to quick and easy details. Here\u2019s 5 you can do in less than 60 minutes!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/87?query=public%20profile%20url\">Customize your LinkedIn Public Profile URL<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Would you be able to easily recall a website if its\u00a0URL consisted only of random numbers and symbols? Probably not! Customizing your public profile URL to reflect your first and last name makes your profile more shareable and memorable.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/34325?query=add%20media\">Add Media to your Summary section<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn Profiles tend to look pretty plain: black text on a white background on a gray page. So, how do you stand out? With interactive media, of course! You can upload samples of your work or other media, including youtube videos and blogs, that support your professional views and\/or industry. These elements will make your profile more engaging, and therefore more memorable to whoever is browsing it. They might even start as a conversation starter.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/2901?query=change%20headline\">Make Your Headline Action-Oriented, Customer-Centric<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By default, your profile Headline will automatically change to the title of your current\/most recent job position. That\u2019s great \u2013 until you think about how many other LinkedIn members out there have the same one. Since your Headline is one of the first things people see on your profile <em>and<\/em> in any InMails you send, you need to treat that space as your 15 second elevator pitch.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a Salesman of IT products, you and everyone else in your team may have a headline of \u201cIT Sales Professional.\u201d If someone were to receive an InMail or look at your profile, they may think <em>I don\u2019t want to deal with someone trying to sell me something right now!<\/em> and navigate away.<\/p>\n<p>But if you were to change that to something more inviting to your potential customers, it may just be the hook you need to draw them in further. Something closer to \u201cEmpowering Business Professionals with Innovative Cloud Tech Solutions\u201d shows customers you care about them, who you\u2019re aiming for, and what services you offer. If someone has been thinking about looking into cloud solutions, they will be much more likely to reach out or answer you with a headline like this!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/49960?query=background\">Add A Background Photo<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Background photos are just another easy way to make your profile stand out. Instead of the plain blue background, you could choose something closer to home, such as your city\u2019s skyline or even something to do with your company! Just make sure it\u2019s relatively simple so that the focus remains on your profile itself. You wouldn\u2019t want to put up a \u2018Where\u2019s Waldo\u2019 image \u2013 unless you were Waldo, of course. Then that\u2019d be pretty cool.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/47992?query=who%27s%20viewed%20your%20profile\">Let People See You Looked at Their Profiles<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is the tip that I\u2019ve had many people argue against. \u201cIsn\u2019t that creepy?\u201d They ask. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a <em>LinkedIn feature<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I understand the concern, though. If you\u2019re caught looking at a potential customer\u2019s profile or maybe even a competitor\u2019s salesman\u2019s profile, you don\u2019t want them to <em>know<\/em> you\u2019re researching them. For some it\u2019s a privacy thing \u2013 for others, it\u2019s a pride thing. No matter what it is, this <em>thing<\/em> is hurting the potential of your personal brand.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe a few people <em>will<\/em> see it as creepy. Maybe a few people <em>will<\/em> be amused that their rival(s) are referencing them for tips. But the majority of people will not know you and click out of curiosity, meaning you\u2019ll get an increase in traffic to your profile \u2013 and, by extension, the more you\u2019ll show up in other people\u2019s <em>related<\/em> profiles. This means that your LinkedIn profile will have an increased audience of potential customers who can see how many of a knowledgeable expert you are in your industry. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.<\/p>\n<p>This article may be titled \u201cThings You Can Do In 1 Hour\u201d, but the truly computer savvy can get it done is maybe 20 minutes tops.
