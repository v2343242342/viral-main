How could we possibly know how to master social media marketing during the first pandemic of its kind in this digital era?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re immersing ourselves in social media and helping all of our clients navigate this difficult time. We won\u2019t claim to know all the social media dos and don\u2019ts during this \u2026 unprecedented time \u2026 but we have listed below a few ways to stay on top of your game.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Acknowledge it<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, let your social media followers know that your business is more than aware of the times that we are in. Mention how this will change business as usual and <em>how<\/em> this will change business as usual. If COVID-19 isn\u2019t looking like it\u2019s going to change the way your business runs, say so. Your customers need to know how this will effect your deliverables, hours, shipping, timelines, etc.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are struggling to figure out how best to do this, have a look below:\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4311\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Screen-Shot-2020-04-24-at-2.21.02-PM.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A simple graphic like the one above can be put together on Canva or Photoshop. Add in a caption explaining the changes or linking to your website with more information.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If your business has already announced how COVID-19 will effect your usual runnings, update your community regularly.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Check In<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that everything happening surrounding COVID-19 is terrifying. Everyone is having to face the fear of the unknown and it is unsettling. Have you thought to check in with your followers?\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ask them how they are doing, provide some resources for local mental health organizations or provide a distraction or comic relief. Part of what is \u2018unprecindented\u2019 about this time is the opportunity that exists for businesses large and small. The world is in tune and watching, particularly online, to how businesses are responding to this crisis. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How are you treating your employees? How are you handling delays? Customer service?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now is the time to highlight what your company is doing right to solidify the positive outlook your customers have of your values.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Change It Up<\/strong> \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s safe to say, it\u2019s not business as usual. Even if not much has changed in terms of your operation, your customers are not business as usual. They\u2019re likely stuck inside, perhaps short of income and on edge.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are you running ads on social media or Google? Be sure to acknowledge the current crisis in your active ads. Your customers are highly likely to swipe by if it looks like your ads are not current. And in the times we\u2019re in, it\u2019s easy to tell!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While you\u2019re at it, check in on your current offers or specials. While many people are out of work, some may be hesitant to make purchases simple because they don\u2019t know what tomorrow could bring.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, offer a special offer or discount relating specifically to the current crisis. Perhaps free shipping, extended returns, or a unique service guarantee.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you need any help with the above, we\u2019re here. We know what the social landscape and we\u2019re experts in <em>your<\/em> business on social. If you take nothing else away, remember this: don\u2019t ignore COVID-19. In these uncertain times, be certain about what your business stands for and how you\u2019ll be there for your customers here and now.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We know what you\u2019re thinking.
