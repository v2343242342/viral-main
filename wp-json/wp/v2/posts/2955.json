Commercials like this that call out competitors so candidly are assumed to be coming from a place of pure confidence. This inspires people to do research and follow their calls to action in order to verify credibility, and increases overall brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s not talk about Sprint\u2019s marketing win. Let\u2019s take a peek at the situation from Verizon\u2019s point of view, and explore the reasons why pinning so much onto a spokesperson can be a big risk.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Brand Voice<\/h2>\n<p>The \u2018voice\u2019 of your company is a big deal, even if you don\u2019t actively think about it. Would you expect 80\u2019s slang in a Microsoft ad? Of course not! Microsoft\u2019s tone is interpreted as professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. In no way would you expect them to invite you to try this\u00a0<em>bangin\u2019<\/em> new operating system or talk about how cloud technology is\u00a0<em>totally tubular.<\/em>\u00a0If you want your brand to represent its products, services, and values properly, you need to develop a distinct brand voice.<\/p>\n<h2>The\u00a0Beauty Of Spokespeople<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/img.buzzfeed.com\/buzzfeed-static\/static\/enhanced\/webdr03\/2013\/1\/8\/12\/enhanced-buzz-30925-1357667439-0.jpg\" alt=\"Flo from Progressive Insurance, a popular spokeswoman and promoter of the company's brand.\" width=\"180\" height=\"219\" \/>With all that in mind, it\u2019s easy to\u00a0hire a spokesperson to\u00a0<em>become<\/em> the voice of your company. In the case of Flo from Progressive, all you need to do is create a character that embodies your brand voice and let the hired actor or actress bring it to life.<\/p>\n<p>Flo is portrayed as a down-to-earth, quirky, and funny woman who is passionate about helping others save money. She\u2019s confident, knowledgeable in her work, and basically sets the expectations for what people imagine a Progressive employee to be.<\/p>\n<p>From here on, all the marketing team for Progressive has to do is come up with ways to leverage Flo\u2019s character in a variety of ways: commercials, print ads, digital ads, etc. All the actress in question (Stephanie Courtney) has to do is follow the script to stay on brand. Sounds simple, right?<\/p>\n<h2>But\u00a0Employees Are Only Human<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net\/drunken-peasants-podcast\/images\/3\/34\/Jared_Fogle.jpg\/revision\/latest?cb=20150822020904\" alt=\"Jared, the now infamous spokesman of Subway who's inspiring weight loss story was overshadowed by criminal charges. These charges didn't help Subway's brand at all.\" width=\"249\" height=\"219\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like with Paul\u2019s betrayal of Verizon (although it\u2019s less a betrayal and more a \u2018the\u00a0non-compete clause ran out\u2019, I\u2019m sure), companies have no way of ensuring a spokesperson\u2019s permanent lifelong loyalty. They also can\u2019t control what their spokesperson does\u00a0<em>outside<\/em> of work \u2014 which, despite it not being related, can still impact perception of the\u00a0brand in a\u00a0<strong>major<\/strong> way.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most infamous cases of this is Subway\u2019s Jared Fogle, who used to be known for his impressive weight loss due to eating Subway sandwiches. Unfortunately, the \u2018Subway Guy\u2019 eventually ended up in jail due to\u00a0charges of child pornography and soliciting sex with minors. Once that bomb dropped,\u00a0all Subway could do was initiate tons of\u00a0<strong><em>damage control.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Know The Risks<\/h2>\n<p>Understand\u00a0that I\u2019m not trying to dissuade anyone from using a spokesperson for their company\u2019s brand.\u00a0The right actor or actress can do a lot of good for your company by becoming a friendly face associated with your values, products, and services. But that same face can easily be associated with not-so-great things, too. If you think the potential cons outweigh the pros, you may want to stick to a talking animal instead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For additional thoughts on brand voice, check out:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-GB\/developers\/articles\/week02feb13\/tone-of-voice-and-brand-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tone of Voice and Brand Identity \u2013 Microsoft Developer<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/business\/business-news\/subways-challenge-how-erase-jared-fogle-its-brand-n412531\">Subway\u2019s Challenge: How to Erase Jared Fogle From Its Brand<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/brandmentions.com\/blog\/best-social-media-analytics-tools\/\">Best Social Media Analytics Tools &#8211; Brand Mentions<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I first saw the \u201cPaul Switched\u201d commercial for Sprint, the first words out of my mouth were: \u2018Shots fired, Verizon!\u2019 I was shocked and impressed. which is\u00a0exactly what Sprint was going for.
