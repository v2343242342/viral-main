If you\u2019re not, or if you haven\u2019t been making it a top priority, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re missing out on some great perks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is social media so important? Listed below are some of the top ways it benefits your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expand Your Reach<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are billions of people (over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wearesocial.com\/blog\/2020\/01\/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.8 billion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to be specific) who use social media every day, and even more people have been spending time online since the COVID-19 pandemic started last year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you invest in social media, it\u2019s easier for you to reach your customers where they are (on the internet) and reach them instantly. Social media also gives you a chance to build brand recognition and get your business&#8217;s name out there.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, it takes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/branding-statistics\/#gref\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5-7 impressions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before someone can recognize your brand. The more they see your posts and advertisements online, the sooner they\u2019ll remember your business and think of you when they need products or services like the ones you offer.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversify Your Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of COVID-19, some traditional marketing methods aren&#8217;t possible or practical.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most businesses have shifted to place a greater emphasis on online marketing since their target audiences are staying home and spending more time online. There\u2019s no use in spending a ton of money on a billboard, for example, if people aren\u2019t going out and driving on the highway to see it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media marketing allows you to diversify your approach and promote your business in different ways. This, in turn, helps you to reach more people and ensure your company continues to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save on Marketing Expenses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With social media marketing, you\u2019re able to advertise to a large number of users without spending a ton of money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is a cost-effective option for businesses that are short on cash. It\u2019s free to set up a profile on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It\u2019s also free to publish and share content with your followers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for advertising, most paid promotions are relatively inexpensive, especially compared to traditional marketing costs. This helps you to trim your marketing budget without sacrificing exposure, and it also allows you to see a return on your investment sooner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve Search Engine Ranking<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that social media marketing is good for your search engine ranking?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The size of your social media following doesn\u2019t directly influence your ranking on search engine results pages. However, there is a correlation between social media presence and search engine ranking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you use social media regularly, you create more opportunities for people to link back to your website content. You also have more chances to build an audience and promote your products and services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this drives traffic to your website, which boosts your search engine ranking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish and Build Credibility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking to establish credibility and help your audience see you as an authority figure in your industry, social media is an important factor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is a great place where you can share information, answer questions, and educate your audience on what you have to offer. You can also provide links back to your blog, which makes it easier for you to provide long-form answers and more thorough education than what you can deliver in an Instagram post or Twitter thread.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this gives you a chance to show off your knowledge. It also helps your audience to view you as a trustworthy source.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn from Your Audience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media doesn\u2019t just allow you to share content with your audience. It also creates opportunities for you to engage with and learn from your followers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you can post polls online to find out what kinds of posts your audience wants to see in the future. You can also ask if people have questions about your products or services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This last point is especially helpful. When you post calls for questions, this gives you a chance to refine your marketing approach and ensure you\u2019re sharing relevant details about your business and what you have to offer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more specific you are in the information you share, the more likely people are to understand your business and buy what you\u2019re selling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor Your Competitors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to learning about your audience, social media also gives you a chance to learn about your competition. When you create a presence on popular platforms, you can follow your competitors and keep an eye on the kinds of posts they\u2019re creating and the ways they\u2019re marketing their business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal here isn\u2019t to copy them, of course. However, checking out what they\u2019re doing can inspire you when you\u2019re coming up with ideas for your own marketing campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitoring your competition also helps you to identify gaps in their marketing plan. You can then fill those gaps when you publish <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promotional posts and advertisements.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase Conversions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these different advantages lead to an increase in the thing every business owner wants more of: Conversions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not enough just to have more people visiting your website. You also want them to make purchases, right?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong social media presence will help people to develop trust in your brand and become curious about your products and services. This, in turn, will lead to them buying what you\u2019re selling so they can check it out for themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see an especially significant increase in conversions when you take the time to build relationships with your audience on social media.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/business-chief\/how-to-develop-an-effective-social-media-strategy-cc3e327c2b04\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">51 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of marketers, strong relationships have led to boosts in sales. Research also shows that, compared to outbound marketing, social media marketing has a 100 percent higher lead-to-close rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start Investing in Social Media Today<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, there are lots of ways that social media can benefit your business, from boosting search engine rankings and building credibility to learning about your audience and increasing conversions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t been investing in a social media marketing strategy, now is the perfect time to start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image source: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/tLZhFRLj6nY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsplash<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you investing in social media as part of your business\u2019s marketing strategy?
