Here are some specific benefits social media has to offer recruiters:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Greater Reach<\/b>: With over <a href=\"https:\/\/wearesocial.com\/blog\/2020\/01\/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media\"><span class=\"s2\">3.8 billion<\/span><\/a> social media users worldwide, businesses can use social media platforms to get in touch with tons of potential employees<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>More Targeted Ads<\/b>: With tools like Facebook Ads, you can make your advertisements highly targeted and reach a specific group of people that meet your unique criteria<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>More Qualified Leads<\/b>: Social media allows you to identify qualified and well-rounded candidates; sites like LinkedIn, in particular, can connect you right away to industry professionals<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Easier Review<\/b>: Many people find it easier to review applications and get to know candidates through social media than through traditional recruitment methods<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Use Social Media for Recruiting<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Okay, you\u2019re convinced that there are benefits to using social media for recruiting. Where do you start, though? <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Here are some tips that will help you find qualified candidates in no time:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Engage with Potential Candidates<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The more engaged you are on social media, the easier it is to build relationships and get people interested in joining your team. Be friendly and personable, respond to questions and comments promptly, and ask genuine questions to get to know people better to see if they\u2019re a good fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Don\u2019t Spam People<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t be spammy. If you\u2019re constantly flooding people\u2019s inboxes with recruitment messages, they\u2019re going to get frustrated and will likely block you. That\u2019s not helpful when you\u2019re trying to build your team, is it?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Remember Social Media Best Practices<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of post you\u2019re putting together. Always remember social media best practices. Best practices, in this case, include using hashtags that are relevant to your business and your recruitment goals. Include high-quality videos and photos that align with your brand and show off the best parts of your business, too. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Make Your Ads Extra-Specific<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re creating a social media ad for a new position, make it as targeted as possible. Be clear about the age, education level, and location of the people you\u2019re trying to reach. This helps you ensure you\u2019re getting in touch with the right candidates.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Work with a Professional<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re still feeling lost, don\u2019t be afraid to work with a professional, too. A social media agency can help you fine-tune your approach, eliminate the guesswork, and maximize the results you see from your recruiting efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Work with a Social Media Agency for Recruiting Today<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Are you interested in using a social media agency for recruiting?
