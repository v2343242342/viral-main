Are you unsure of how to incorporate influencers into your overall digital marketing approach?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If so, keep reading. Listed below are some top influencer social media agency strategies that are highly effective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Use Influencer Marketing?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some marketers are eager to use influencer marketing but aren\u2019t sure how. Others are still on the fence about whether or not this particular social media marketing strategy is worthwhile.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you fall into the latter camp, here are some benefits of influencer marketing that might change your mind:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Increased Engagement<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Influencer marketing is a great way to get your products or services in front of a larger audience. When you work with someone who has already earned the trust of their following, people are going to be more inclined to look up your brand and check out what you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that influencers can generate higher rates of user engagement than content that a brand publishes itself. The average engagement rate when working with influencers is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/influencer-marketing-statistics\">5.7 percent<\/a>. In contrast, the average engagement rate for branded content is just 2.3 percent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Increased Conversions<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does influencer marketing lead to higher engagement rates, but it also leads to increased conversions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When they start partnering with influencers, many brands notice an uptick in their sales and improvements to their bottom line. If you\u2019re looking to make your brand more profitable (and what business owner isn\u2019t?), influencer marketing is a great option to consider.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Great ROI<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just how effective is influencer marketing? Most businesses see significant returns on their investments from partnering with influencers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-statistics\/\">one report<\/a>, businesses earned an average of $5.20 for every $1.00 spent on influencer marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/IM_Benchmark_Report_2019.pdf\">Another report<\/a> showed that the ROI could be as high as $18.00 for every $1.00 spent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With numbers like that in mind, why wouldn\u2019t you want to start making influencer marketing part of your digital marketing plan?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Influencer Social Media Agency Strategies<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, you\u2019re convinced that influencer marketing is worth investigating. Where to do you begin, though?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the most effective strategies that social media agencies like ours swear by:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Set Clear Goals<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Start by figuring out what you want to accomplish with your influencer marketing campaigns. Is your goal to build brand awareness? Expand your audience to include an older or younger demographic?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Setting goals first will help to guide your decisions moving forward. For example, let\u2019s say you want to appeal to a younger audience. If this is the case, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re partnering with an influencer whose audience is made up primarily of younger people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Identify Your Message<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, think about the kind of message that you want influencers to deliver about your brand. It\u2019s not enough just to pay someone with a lot of followers to say whatever they want about your products or services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Think about how you want them to talk about your brand and identify any key points that you want them to be sure to include when talking about it (e.g., you only use sustainable materials in your packaging, your product is 100 percent organic, etc.).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Consider Different Types of Influencer Marketing Campaigns<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of different ways that influencers can showcase your products or services and present them to their followers. The following are some of the most popular types of influencer marketing campaigns you might want to consider using:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Gifting<\/strong>: Giving away free products or services to an influencer so they can review or mention them<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Guest Posting<\/strong>: Contributing to an influencer\u2019s blog<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Sponsored Content<\/strong>: Paying to have your brand featured on an influencer\u2019s blog or social media platform<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Contests and Giveaways<\/strong>: Asking an influencer to share your contest or giveaway event with their followers<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Takeovers<\/strong>: Allowing an influencer to have control of your social media accounts for a pre-determined amount of time (usually no more than 24 hours)<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Affiliates<\/strong>: Providing influencers with a code that gives them a percentage of the sales they help to drive<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Partner with Micro-Influencers<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When they\u2019re first getting started in the influencer marketing world, a lot of brands make the mistake of only going after partnerships with influencers who have hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of followers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that partnerships with micro-influencers, people who have smaller followings (10,000 to 100,000 followers), can often be more effective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Micro-influencers might have a smaller reach, but they also have more targeted and loyal audiences. Their audiences also tend to have higher levels of engagement. As a result, they\u2019re more likely to check out the brands their favorite influencers are promoting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Working with micro-influencers is usually more cost-effective than partnering with folks who have massive followings, too. If your brand is working with a limited budget, this can be a better option to consider.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Work with a Social Media Agency<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t underestimate the value of working with a social media agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you partner with an agency, they can handle various parts of the influencer marketing process for you. This includes finding influencers who are a good fit for your brand and who are interested in building a genuine relationship with you (rather than having a purely transactional interaction).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A social media agency can also help you to decide which types of marketing campaigns will be most effective. They can then measure the results of these campaigns to better inform your decisions in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Start Using Influencer Marketing Today<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there are lots of influencer social media strategies that you can start using to build your brand and increase your reach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re daunted by the idea of implementing these strategies on your own, don\u2019t forget that working with a social media agency can help.
