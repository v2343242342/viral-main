With millions of users visiting LinkedIn daily, the opportunities for marketers seem endless.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Using LinkedIn for B2B marketing has become an integral part of many successful promotional campaigns. With\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/generate-leads-on-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">80% of B2B social marketing leads coming from LinkedIn<\/a>, it&#8217;s important to take full advantage of this tool.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll discuss strategies to help you start using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/b2b-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn for B2B marketing<\/a>\u00a0today.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Optimize Your Company Page<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The company page is the &#8220;face&#8221; of your LinkedIn campaign. To work, this major lead generator needs a high-quality structure. While detailed information about your business may seem important, it&#8217;s likely to be skimmed through by the visitors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When restructuring the company page, you need to keep a vital matter in mind:\u00a0<strong>you aren&#8217;t sharing information with other users, you are making a sales pitch.\u00a0<\/strong>Here are several details you need to consider.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Banner Image\u00a0<\/strong>\u2014 catch the page visitor&#8217;s attention with an attractive banner image. The image itself should be pitching your idea and offering value to the viewer. Look at how\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/salesforce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Salesforce has done it<\/a>. The banner describes the intent and draws clients to look more into the offering.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Description<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014 the company&#8217;s description should be catchy and informational, showing readers why they need to work with you. Don&#8217;t pack any extensive text into this section. A short pitch is usually enough to catch the reader&#8217;s attention. They can read more about your company on the website. See how\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/dhl\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DHL has done it<\/a>. Short and sweet. Nothing extra.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Updates\u00a0<\/strong>\u2014 in case your banner and description didn&#8217;t drive the visitor to your website, you can get their attention with updates. Make sure that in addition to valuable content and an occasional CTA, they provide an opportunity to visit your website.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Profile\u00a0<\/strong>\u2014 make sure to fill out your profile (even if the audience isn&#8217;t likely to browse it). The information must be readily available for their use. Publish articles to your profile to establish yourself as an influencer. Request recommendations from your connections to highlight your expertise. Display your successful projects and list all relevant certifications, patents, and awards.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Take Advantage of Showcase Pages<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/44863?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Showcase pages<\/a>\u00a0are your opportunity to go into detail promoting some of your products or services. LinkedIn allows you to create affiliate pages, which are listed on the right-hand side of your main company page (check\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/adobe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how Adobe has done it<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These pages are an excellent opportunity for segmentation marketing. You can reach different parts of your target audience with different messages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All your showcase pages are linked back to your main page so you expand your conversation efforts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"blob:https:\/\/socialistics.com\/69fef34e-e104-45bf-8e06-eb4290c48b38\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Use Website Demographics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>LinkedIn offers a useful marketing tool to collect information about the audience visiting your website. To beef up your LinkedIn B2B marketing campaign, you need to get a better idea about what type of visitors you are dealing with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/website-demographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn Website Demographics<\/a>\u00a0uses the member data to give you extra insight into your visitors&#8217; details. The free tool collects information about the visitor behavior, checks it against the database, and allows you to use it for your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/content-marketing\/linkedin-b2b-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn ad campaign<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can filter the demographic data by<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Job function<\/li>\r\n<li>Job title<\/li>\r\n<li>Company<\/li>\r\n<li>Company industry<\/li>\r\n<li>Job seniority<\/li>\r\n<li>Company size<\/li>\r\n<li>Location<\/li>\r\n<li>Country<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This can help:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tailor your social media and website content according to the audience&#8217;s needs.<\/li>\r\n<li>Build detailed client\/customer personas.<\/li>\r\n<li>Validate the advertising platform quality to make sure you are pitching to the right clients.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/sales-solutions\/sales-navigator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn Sales Navigator<\/a>\u00a0is a social selling tool. It has a variety of features to help you reach the target audience and build valuable relationships with it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can discover leads by using search and filter features. The platform also offers valuable insights into the target audience&#8217;s behavior. It can help you create personalized content, customize your offers, set up relevant discounts, and more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This paid tool caters to B2B marketers with different needs. You can choose the subscription tier most suitable for your goals. The Sales Navigator is a highly diverse marketing instrument with numerous features, some of which\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/hidden-sales-navigator-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">require detailed exploration.\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Share High-Quality Content<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the B2B marketing chessboard, content isn&#8217;t the king. It&#8217;s the queen. About\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/2019_B2B_Research_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">93% of B2B marketers<\/a>\u00a0report that their organization is highly committed to content marketing. When using LinkedIn for B2B marketing, the value of top-notch content is hard to overlook.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While you shouldn&#8217;t forget about the power of smart CTAs, your content on LinkedIn shouldn&#8217;t be salesy. Instead, it can focus on insider knowledge, helpful tips, interesting practices, and anything that establishes your company as an influencer, authority, and industry leader.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of your LinkedIn content is to create trust and build the audience&#8217;s interest. Once that happens, they are likelier to visit your website where the sales pitch awaits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep status updates short and to the point.<\/li>\r\n<li>Add images, documents, videos, and hashtags to improve post visibility.<\/li>\r\n<li>Keep the content coming. Post at least once a day.<\/li>\r\n<li>Ask your employees to help with marketing and repost your LinkedIn content.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Take Advantage of Groups<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>LinkedIn has millions of different groups. Find those, which are relevant to your niche and join. By being active in these groups, you can raise brand awareness and foster important relationships.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>LinkedIn ranks groups according to their activity level. So make sure to join highly active groups.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid crowded groups. Your activity may be lost in the sea of other posts.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With time, you may want to consider creating your own group. Setting up and maintaining such a community doesn&#8217;t just establish you as an influencer but boosts conversions substantially.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Takeaway<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Using LinkedIn for B2B marketing isn&#8217;t just a nice addition to your promotional efforts. This strategy is an integral part of a solid marketing campaign.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The main advantage LinkedIn has over other social media channel is the users&#8217; attitude.
