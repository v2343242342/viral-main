A General One"},"content":{"rendered":"\r\n<p>When it comes to social media marketing, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. That\u2019s why working with a professional can be so helpful. It\u2019s important to note, though, that not all professionals have the same level of expertise. If you want to hire a professional or team of professionals to assist you in your social media marketing efforts, you might be thinking about hiring a general marketing agency that does a little bit of everything (including social media marketing).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is one option, but you\u2019ll likely be better off working with a social media agency that specializes exclusively in social media marketing. Read on to learn about the specific benefits these types of agencies have to offer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>More Experienced Staff<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To get a job at a marketing agency that specializes in a particular service, such as social media marketing, employees need to have a lot of knowledge and experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Because their social media agency only offers a specific type of service, the folks who run it are typically going to be more scrupulous with their hiring practices. They\u2019re not just going to bring in anyone who has a Twitter account. Instead, they\u2019ll only add people to their team who have an expansive understanding of social media marketing, as well as a passion for this particular part of the industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This high level of experience works in your favor. When you enlist the services of a specialist social media agency, you get to rest easy knowing that your business\u2019s social media marketing strategy is being handled by true professionals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>More Services<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media agencies, of course, will only offer services related to social media marketing. At the same time, though, there\u2019s also a good chance that their social media services will extend way beyond what a generalist marketing agency can provide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A general marketing agency likely offers some standard social media marketing services, usually tacked on as an afterthought. Maybe they\u2019ll help you put together some content or learn the basics of paid advertising, for example.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An agency that specializes in social media marketing, on the other hand, will do this and much more. They\u2019ll help you to create content, put together paid advertising campaigns, build a community, partner with influencers, and asses analytics so you can make informed choices moving forward.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>More Attention<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, a specialized social media agency can provide you and your business\u2019s social media strategy with more attention than a generalized agency can. People who work for general agencies typically have a lot of different tasks that they\u2019re juggling at once (for lots of different clients).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Because the workers at a social media agency only have to worry about your company\u2019s social media strategy, they can spend more time working on it. They can also help you to fine-tune your approach without having to worry that they\u2019re neglecting other parts of your marketing plan.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Better Results<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Agencies that specialize in a specific service like social media marketing are often more effective than agencies that try to do everything for everyone. When you consider the fact that, with a social media agency, you\u2019re getting access to more experience, more services, and more attention from employees, it makes sense that you\u2019re going to have a better end result.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most social media agencies will also provide you with detailed analytics and assessments so you can measure your progress. You\u2019ll be able to see exactly how well you\u2019re doing, as well as what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. This, in turn, will make it easier for you to adjust your strategy moving forward so you continue to see improvements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>More Bang for Your Buck<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At first, the idea of hiring an agency only for social media marketing might seem too expensive. Don\u2019t forget, though, that these agencies can provide a lot of value (more than what a general agency can provide in most cases).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you work with a social media agency, you\u2019ll likely see better results, and see them faster. You\u2019ll also have access to data that helps you to streamline your approach and continue making progress.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, a general agency might not be able to produce the kind of results that you want. They also might not have access to the kind of data you need to notice the kind of improvements you\u2019re making (or find out if you\u2019re actually making improvements).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Exclusivity<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t underestimate the benefits of exclusivity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For a general marketing agency, social media is often a mere afterthought. They have so many other types of marketing that they\u2019re focusing on, they often don\u2019t have the time or resources to give your social media strategy the attention it deserves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since the folks at social media agencies<em> only <\/em>focus on social media, you can feel confident that your business\u2019s platforms are being handled by professionals who care about your success and aren\u2019t bogged down by other, unrelated tasks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Media Use Is on the Rise<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t forget that social media usage is at an all-time high right now. There are almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/1164\/social-networks\/\">4 million<\/a> social media users worldwide (that\u2019s about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/social-media-marketing-statistics\">45 percent<\/a> of the population), and Facebook alone has over <a href=\"https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/rise-of-social-media\">2.5 million<\/a> users.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media use is only going to continue growing, so social media marketing ought to be a top priority for any business owner that wants to succeed long-term. These business owners deserve to work with partners who have the experience and abilities necessary to maximize their results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Work with a Social Media Agency Today<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you hire a general marketing agency to handle your social media, you\u2019ll likely see some improvements in your approach. If you work with a highly specialized social media agency, though, your results will likely be more significant and will continue to improve.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a social media agency that can help you experience all of the benefits listed above, we\u2019re here to help at Socialistics. <a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> today to learn more about our social media marketing services or to schedule an appointment for a consultation.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to social media marketing, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed.
