Before COVID-19, more than 11 million children in the United States were in \u201cfood insecure\u201d homes. Now projections show it could climb up to 18 million just this year. All children deserve to have food on their plates for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They need this food to grow up healthy and strong. That\u2019s why I am advocating for No Kid Hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No Kid Hungry is a national campaign established in 2010, run by Share Our Strength. This nonprofit organization is working towards ending child hunger and poverty in North America. With the pandemic hitting the United States hard, now more than ever people are struggling to help feed their children. It is estimated that 1 in 4 kids could face hunger this year because of the coronavirus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and for kids it really is. Studies have shown that when children eat breakfast, they are more likely to do well on tests and miss less school. That is why we need to be the voice for these children. Many meal programs and school breakfasts are run by your state\u2019s elected officials, and we need to make sure that they will keep these policies protected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, my family and I have taken action by fundraising, advocating, donating, and dropping off nonperishables for food banks. You may not be able to physically see that you are making a difference, but it feels good knowing it is going to children in need. I am so thankful to be able to have food on my plate, so donating is the least I can do to help make an impact on these children\u2019s lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you or anyone you know may be struggling to put food on the table for their children, No Kid Hungry created a Free Meals Finder to help you find food banks and school meal sites.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nokidhungry.org\/find-free-meals\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.nokidhungry.org\/find-free-meals<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Socialistics Cares is our monthly campaign to give back and be generous to those in need.
