Jim\u2019s Pool Supply, based in Lockport, New York, has over twenty years of experience in the pool supply business. They enjoy helping their customers stay informed and keeping their pools easier to maintain. We began with Jim\u2019s at the beginning of this month and the results have been outstanding.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-4660\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CleanShot-2020-06-16-at-13.25.00@2x-2.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE GOAL<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jim\u2019s Pool Supply initially set out with the goal of increasing traffic to their website. Ultimately, they would like an increase in their sales but wanted to start with increasing engagement and link clicks to the website. As their showroom is closed due to COVID-19, we had to take this local business and create a successful online presence on social media.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE STRATEGY<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the goals set out, we began delving into the strategy creation. In order to increase engagement, we ran an engagement campaign alongside a rockstar content strategy. We produced custom content that was eye-catching and highlighted the unique selling points of Jim\u2019s Pool Supply. From there, we implemented an engagement campaign targeting locals of Lockport who were interested in pools. Another goal of Jim\u2019s was to increase traffic to the website, so alongside a separate link click campaign, we added buttons to every engagement post that directed users to the website. Our link click campaign utilized the best performing content in the engagement campaign with the objective of increasing traffic to the website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p><strong><em>&#8220;We have been so busy!
