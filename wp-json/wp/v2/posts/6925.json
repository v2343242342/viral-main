It has over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/facebook-second-quarter-earnings-rise-continued-user-growth-1305161\">2.7 billion<\/a> active users! Are you using Ecommerce Facebook ads as part of your store\u2019s marketing strategy? If not, you\u2019re likely missing out on reaching a lot of potential customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not sure whether or not ecommerce Facebook ads are worth it? Listed below are some of the most significant ways they can benefit your business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Lots of Ad Options<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest benefits of Facebook ads for e-commerce businesses is the fact that there are lots of different ad options to choose from. The following are some of the most popular Facebook ad types you can use for your e-commerce store:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Canvas ads<\/strong>: Full-screen ads that combine video, text, still images, and calls to action<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Carousel ads<\/strong>: Swipeable ads that allow you to display up to 10 images at a time<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Post engagement ads<\/strong>: Ads that allow for increased reach, more visibility, and better engagement<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Video ads<\/strong>: Showcase videos up to 240 minutes to tell a full story about your brand<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Gif ads<\/strong>: Short, sweet, and engaging videos that are perfect for catching people\u2019s attention<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With so many different options, it\u2019s easy to reach lots of different people with your ads. You can also keep your audience on their toes and ensure they never get bored with them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Expanded Reach<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, Facebook has over 2.7 billion active users. Even if you only reached a tiny fraction of those users, that\u2019s still a lot more people than you\u2019d likely be able to reach using other marketing strategies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook ads help you to get your business in front of more people. It allows you to build brand awareness and get folks interested in what you have to offer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Microtargeting<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another awesome feature of Facebook ads is the ability to microtarget. Microtargeting allows you to fine-tune your ads so that you can easily reach members of your target audience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook allows you to target people based on a variety of factors, including the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Age ranges<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Behaviors<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Connections<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Demographics<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Interests<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Languages<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Locations<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook even lets you target people who are fans of your competitors\u2019 pages. The more targeted your ads are, the more likely they are to convert.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Dynamic Retargeting<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to microtargeting, Facebook allows for dynamic retargeting, too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Retargeting involves reaching out to members of your target audience who have visited your e-commerce store in the past. When you retarget these people, you can remind them of what your business has to offer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, when they first visited the website, they were just curious about your products but weren\u2019t ready to make a purchase. By retargeting them, you can showcase other products or services that you offer. Then, you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting them back to your website again in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Cost-Effective Clicks and Conversions<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are you looking for an advertising method that provides a lot of bang for your buck? If so, Facebook ads are a great option to consider.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The price of advertising on the platform is already quite low. The amount of specificity with which you can target your audience also increases your likelihood of seeing a return on your investment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Custom Calls to Action<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you\u2019re creating Facebook ads, you can also customize your ads\u2019 calls to action.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if you want people to \u201cShop Now\u201d, \u201cOrder Today\u201d, or \u201cSign Up Here.\u201d Regardless of your goals, you can customize your call-to-action to get people to do exactly what you want them to do.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Robust Analytics<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t forget that Facebook provides you with robust analytics to assess your ads and figure out what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The following are just some of the analytics Facebook offers:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Weekly ad reach<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Post engagement<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Number of page likes<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Top-performing posts<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Clicks<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Conversions<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this data at your fingertips, it\u2019s easy to adjust your Facebook ads to ensure maximum performance. You never have to play the guessing game with your advertising strategy again.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Tips for Better E-Commerce Facebook Ads<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, Facebook ads have a lot of benefits.
