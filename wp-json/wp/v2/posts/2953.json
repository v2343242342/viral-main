When it comes to Pokemon Go marketing, however, the benefits are up for grabs \u2014 so long as you know how to use them!<\/p>\n<h2>What is Pokemon Go?<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you have an avid interest in video games or not, most people have heard about the\u00a0<em>Pokemon<\/em> franchise \u2014 or can at least recognize its popular mascot, Pikachu. For those of you completely in the dark, Pokemon is a series of video games (and graphic novels and a very long animated series and movies\u2026) that revolve around a fictional world inhabited by creatures called Pokemon (Pocket Monsters) that are captured and trained by humans. Sometimes these creatures do battle, sometimes they\u2019re just sort of service animals, sometimes they\u2019re studied \u2014 regardless, the overall goal is to catch and raise these critters and occasionally pit them against one another.<\/p>\n<p>Pokemon Go is a mobile app that uses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/tech\/elements\/pokemon-go-will-make-you-crave-augmented-reality\">Augmented Reality (AR) technology<\/a> to impose images of these creatures on screens overlaying the real world. Using a Google-Maps-esque user interface, it encourages players to run around and explore their location to find these monsters, which pop up across the map from time to time, in order to capture and train them to do battle around certain points of the map. Simple, right?<\/p>\n<h2>Why Should I Care?<\/h2>\n<p>Pokemon Go marketing can reach many playersYou should care because Pokemon Go isn\u2019t just aimed at kids with pocket change. Many,\u00a0<em>many<\/em> Millennials are out there every day instead of being cooped up inside their homes and exploring new parts of their neighborhood. In addition to that, they\u2019re meeting and socializing with people they possibly would have\u00a0<em>never<\/em>met otherwise! And it\u2019s not just Millennials, either. On my own personal Pokemon Go adventures, I\u2019ve stumbled across parents\u00a0in their 40\u2019s sharing the experience of catching virtual Pokemon with their younger children \u2014 and even enjoying it without them! If you\u2019re aiming for this sort of audience you\u00a0<em>need<\/em> to understand the leverage you could have thanks to\u00a0this app, especially since it\u2019s only going to improve with time and build in popularity.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Do I Use Pokemon Go Marketing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The answer is simple: Get these Pokemon Go trainers to hang out at your place. In order to do this, you\u2019ll need to learn a teensy bit more about one of the game mechanics: Poke Stops. Poke Stops are random points all over the map at which players\u00a0can pick up new items just by visiting the location. Poke Stops can also have Lures attached to them, which draw Pokemon to their location for 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>If your business is close enough to one of these Poke Stops, all you need to do is <em>drop a Lure on this locale and wait.\u00a0<\/em>Invest in a charging station or two (since the app can drain battery quickly), advertise your awareness of the app, and encourage your employees to familiarize themselves with it \u2014 especially those of the millennial generation. Pokemon Go players would much rather catch these creatures in the comfort of a booth in your coffee shop than standing outside sweating in the summer heat! Plus, it\u2019s a great way to draw shy folks out of their shell by putting them in what they perceive to be a safe, encouraging space.<\/p>\n<p>Getting a Lure item, however, will cost you a little bit of an investment. Lures are purchasable via microtransactions in the Shop section of the Pokemon Go app. A package of 8 Pokemon Lures (4 hours) costs 680 Pokecoins, with roughly $1 USD = 100 coins. The more coins you buy, the less it\u2019ll cost, as with any \u2018buy in bulk\u2019 deal, though, so if you want to drop $100 for 14,500 coins, be our guest!<\/p>\n<p>My recommendation? If you\u2019re a small business owner and close to a PokeStop, spend $10 for roughly 8 hours of Lures and experiment. Make sure you advertise your awareness of the app and see how your customers respond to see if it\u2019s worth further investment, testing on different days and different times of day to maximize exposure.\u00a0Just like in the Pokemon Go app, it can\u2019t hurt to try and catch \u2019em all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you a Pokemon Go player?
