Are you on the fence about whether you should use a virtual marketing agency or a more traditional one?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are benefits to each of these options, but most marketers who have tried both have found that going virtual will provide more bang for your buck. Discussed below are the top five benefits that a virtual marketing agency has to offer to your business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is a Virtual Marketing Agency?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual marketing agency is identical to a traditional marketing agency when it comes to the work they do. The big difference is the way they do that work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you think of a marketing agency, you likely think of a big, shiny building full of people bustling around in suits and talking about ad copy. You know, like Mad Men.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s one way to run a marketing agency. In 2020, though, it\u2019s not very practical. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been an influx of virtual agencies over the last few years, and more are expected to continue popping.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual marketing agencies can run from anywhere in the world. Marketers work from home offices or coworking spaces, and they connect to their colleagues (and clients) virtually via phone, chat, and email.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Top 5 Benefits of a Virtual Marketing Agency<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Confused about why you should choose a virtual marketing agency over a traditional one? Here are five reasons to give it a try:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>1. More Competitive Rates<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re like most business owners, especially small- and medium-sized business owners, you\u2019re always looking for ways to save money as you work to grow your business and attract new clients or customers. One way you can do this is by hiring a virtual marketing agency to help you with your social media marketing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you work with a virtual agency, you can expect to pay a fraction of what you\u2019d pay a traditional agency for your social media marketing needs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual agencies have less overhead since they don\u2019t have to worry about things like paying rent or utilities for a giant office building. Because they\u2019re saving money on overhead, they\u2019re able to provide you with high-quality marketing services at a lower price than what a traditional agency charges.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2. More Accessibility<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you hire a team from a traditional marketing agency to handle your social media marketing, you\u2019ll find that your access to them is fairly limited. They likely only work during typical business hours (9-5, give or take an hour), with no one around on the weekends.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a business owner, you work all the time. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could access someone to ask for advice or check on a project even when you\u2019re working on the weekend or later in the evening? With a virtual team, that\u2019s an option.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, virtual agencies will have team members who are spread out all across the world. Because they live and work in different time zones, they are often more accessible than people working at a traditional agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3. More Responsive<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only are virtual agencies often more accessible than traditional agencies, but their team members also tend to be much more responsive.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In a traditional marketing agency, workers spend a lot of time on the phone or at their desks working on various projects. They might not check their email as often as their clients would like.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People who work for virtual agencies, on the other hand, are often much more \u201cplugged in\u201d because they have to stay connected to their colleagues. This also means they\u2019re checking their messages more frequently, which allows them to get back to you faster when you have questions or concerns.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re tired of waiting hours or even days for a marketing team to get back to you, it might be time to give the virtual approach a try.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>4. More Technologically Savvy<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on how old the traditional marketing agency that you\u2019re thinking of using is, its workers might not be as technologically savvy as you\u2019d like.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In many old school marketing agencies, team members are still working on mastering the basics of social media marketing. That\u2019s not particularly helpful when you\u2019re running a modern business and trying to build a significant online presence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual agency, on the other hand, requires its team members to possess a high level of knowledge regarding technology, not to mention the latest social media marketing tools and trends. With this expanded knowledge base, it\u2019ll be much easier for a virtual team to provide you with the assistance you need and help you to see results faster.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Better Talent<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, virtual agencies have access to a much larger talent pool than traditional marketing agencies. A traditional agency can only hire people who live relatively close to where its office building is located. A virtual agency, in contrast, can hire people from anywhere in the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With so many more marketers to choose from, it makes sense that a virtual agency would have better talent and be better equipped to provide you with the social media marketing assistance that you need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t limit yourself to only the social media marketers who live in your area. Expand your horizons and work with an agency that hires the best people in the world to handle your social media marketing campaigns.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Start Working with a Virtual Marketing Agency Today<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there are plenty of advantages that a virtual marketing agency provides that traditional agencies typically can\u2019t. Not only do they offer a higher level of service and increased accessibility, but they do it all at a more affordable price. What more could you want?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are you ready to experience these benefits and start growing your business?
