These updates have changed a variety of features on Apple devices, including their privacy features.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Are you concerned about how these updates will affect your business, specifically when it comes to Facebook advertising? Have you already started noticing changes in your ad reach or response?<\/p>\n<p>If you said \u201cyes\u201d to either question, keep reading. Outlined below are some important details about these updates to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>What is iOS 14?<\/h3>\n<p>According to Apple, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT211808\">iOS 14<\/a> makes changes to the \u201ccore experience\u201d of the iPhone. It includes changes to the home screen\u2019s widgets, as well as a new way to organize the apps.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For many people, though, including business owners, the most important aspects of iOS 14 are the security and privacy features. The new privacy features are designed to include improvements to user transparency, as well as control over the access apps have to the user\u2019s location, microphone, camera, and photos.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>These kinds of changes sound great in theory. In reality, though, it will also lead to major changes for marketers.<\/p>\n<h3>How Will iOS 14 Affect Facebook Ads?<\/h3>\n<p>With the advent of iOS 14, Apple has implemented a new policy that will block certain types of data collection and sharing unless a user opts into tracking after being presented with a prompt.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The more people opt-out of tracking, the less effective the Facebook tracking pixel will be. This, in turn, also means that ads and performance reports will be limited.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>iOS 14 will also weaken advertisers\u2019 targeting options. If people opt-out of tracking, it\u2019ll be harder for businesses to create highly personalized ads. This may also lead to wasted money on ad spending and a reduction in personalization when it comes to writing ad copy.<\/p>\n<h3>The following are some specific outcomes marketers might see as more users upgrade to iOS 14:<\/h3>\n<p>Less Efficient Marketing<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest challenges that iOS 14 will present. Moving forward, it\u2019ll be harder than ever to track your audience\u2019s actions the way you once did. Brands will have to go through extra steps to advertise and remarket to people via their mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Lower Conversion Rates<\/p>\n<p>Now that it\u2019s harder to advertise and remarket, it\u2019s likely that many businesses will see a drop in their conversion rates. As ads become less personalized, it will become harder to convince people to visit your website and buy your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>Drops in App Install Ad Revenue<\/p>\n<p>Some experts have estimated that a lack of personalization in online ads could lead to a decrease in revenue of up to <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2020\/06\/18\/value-of-personalized-ads-thriving-app-ecosystem\/\">50 percent<\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is especially problematic for those who develop apps and promote them with Facebook ads. In the wake of iOS 14, there will likely be a decrease in app installations and from app installation revenue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>More Challenges for Small Businesses<\/h3>\n<p>Who will be hit the hardest by the effects of iOS 14 on Facebook marketing? Small businesses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many small businesses don\u2019t have a lot to work with when it comes to marketing budgets. If their marketing efforts become less efficient and start to generate less revenue, it\u2019s going to be even harder for them to see returns on investment and make your business profitable.<\/p>\n<h3>Coping with iOS 14<\/h3>\n<p>Are you concerned about how your business is going to adapt to the changes brought on by iOS 14? If so, here are some tips that can help you prepare and manage the new update:<\/p>\n<h3>Check Your Analytics<\/h3>\n<p>Start by checking your Google Analytics and figuring out how much of your audience currently use Apple devices. This can help you to get an idea of how many of your users are being affected by iOS 14.<\/p>\n<p>To find this number, take a look at your Google Analytics Device Report. Then, click on Audience, then Mobile, then Device. Scroll down to Apple devices to see the percentage of your traffic that will be affected by iOS 14.<\/p>\n<h3>Change Your Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>Changing your ad campaigns is a good temporary step to work around iOS 14 and gain more information for the future. When you\u2019re creating ad campaigns, start excluding iOS devices altogether.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Making this change will help you to get a sense of how the update will affect your business. After you\u2019ve done this, you\u2019ll be able to start making more changes so that you can better cater to your Android audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Set New Objectives<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to give up on Facebook advertising altogether just because people are updating to iOS 14. You may need to change your approach and start creating ads with different objectives, though.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than creating ads with the intent of converting, you may need to start creating them with different goals in mind, such as lead generation or brand awareness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Start Using Post-Purchase Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>There are some steps you can take to work around iOS 14 and adjust your Facebook advertising strategy. However, now is also a great time to change the way you\u2019re marketing your products and services in general.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To figure out where else your audience is spending their time, start sending out post-purchase surveys. When people complete these surveys, it will help you figure out how they learned about your business. With this information, you can start focusing more attention on those avenues and avoid being too reliant on one platform (in this case, Facebook).<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind, it may help to incentivize people to fill out your post-purchase surveys. For example, offer them a 10 percent off coupon for their next purchase after they\u2019ve filled it out and sent it back.<\/p>\n<h3>Focus on Email and Messenger Ads<\/h3>\n<p>You can also place more of an emphasis on email and messenger ads now and in the future. These other types of ads will help you to enjoy more direct contact with your audience. They also allow you to stay in touch no matter what kinds of changes happen on the Facebook front.<\/p>\n<h3>Get Ready for iOS 14 Today<\/h3>\n<p>Apple\u2019s iOS 14 update <i>will<\/i> have an impact on your Facebook advertising strategy. There\u2019s no getting around it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you follow the steps outlined above and get prepared, though, you\u2019ll have no trouble adjusting, keeping your business afloat, and seeing good long-term results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this year, Apple rolled out a new series of updates, collectively known as iOS 14.
