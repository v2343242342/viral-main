How did you report on your social media advertising efforts?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to know if you\u2019re using the right strategies in your social media advertising is to measure your performance using social media metrics.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media metrics are your chance to evaluate the value of your social media advertising strategies and the impact of the smart decisions you\u2019ve made.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media metrics generate the right data needed to assure business owners that their investment in social media advertising is generating results and paying off.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Business owners can also use data from these metrics to make smarter, more data-driven decisions for their business growth and success.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now let\u2019s consider 10 social media metrics every savvy business owner must track to evaluate the performance of their social media marketing efforts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>1. <strong>Audience Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is undoubtedly the first metric to track. The audience metric will help you to determine the characteristics of your audience \u2013 who your audience is.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Note that if you have the wrong set of audience \u2013 audience alignment issue \u2013 your business will suffer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, if your supposed target audience is primarily 45 years to 55 years old men located in Dallas, but your Facebook following is 85% women between ages 20 and 50 from all over the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then you\u2019re attracting the wrong audience with your social media content and wasting your time and money.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Audience metrics to track include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li># of female followers<\/li>\r\n<li># of male followers<\/li>\r\n<li>New accounts you follow<\/li>\r\n<li>Your new followers<\/li>\r\n<li>Primary age group<\/li>\r\n<li>Primary location<\/li>\r\n<li>Total followers<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tracking the audience metric will help you to ensure that you only have real human followers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some tools you can use to track audience metric on social media include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/followerwonk.com\/\">Followerwonk<\/a> \u2013 works for Twitter.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/friendsplus.me\/\">Friends+Me<\/a> \u2013 works for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest.<\/li>\r\n<li>Google Analytics Audience report \u2013 tracks the gender and location of your audience.<\/li>\r\n<li>Social media insights \u2013 tracks the gender and location of your audience.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tailwindapp.com\/\">Tailwind<\/a> \u2013 works for Instagram and Pinterest.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The essence of tracking your audience metric is to know your audience, track their origin and steps, and ensure that the audience engaging with you on social media is the one you\u2019re trying to target.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/SSD305_L-CUnt4LjIrLJBR4NyMDpOQ9soEseIrPS5DISRTKyQKtJOcSPpQJKGVw1a-QbiAyn6kZluv8Pma4CBDWwLy9TeWjWoYDHS3_mipdKJAQkK6EylgTLwmQ4lOWVJ4aOJgYa\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\social-media-metrics-audience-google-analytics-600.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2. Content Metric<\/strong>s<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your content \u2013 original content, text posts, image posts, video posts, link posts, etc. \u2013 is an important tool to attract and engage the audience to your business brand. Your content is what your audience engages with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, tracking content metrics enables you to evaluate the content you share on the social platform and in what specific pattern they are.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the content metric is not the same as the engagement metric. The content metric only evaluates the content you post based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itsma.com\/importance-of-developing-effective-personas\/\">personas<\/a> of your target audience.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are 85% of your social posts image-based while only 15% are text posts? Do you have any video posts? These are questions that the content metric will answer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Content metric will also give you a breakdown of original content versus content posted by others for your business i.e. posts from an influencer or industry expert for your business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Content posted by others includes industry infographics, reviews, guest posts, testimonials, etc. To track this metric, use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agorapulse.com\/\">Agorapulse<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\">BuzzSumo<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/xtwh8mr9lO15KiYlInbl29bCBdEQXVM1p9oGIdtStsbD6ckiev26fgUQVi88WGRmqwtW0Rs1pJS_vsPzNg-fm9_9cJMPRRYPhLm0F9H0k3T1KsLJ51-mmStsEMay9YOOsiAtUlRi\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\social-media-metrics-tools-buzzsumo-600.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These tools would automatically generate a list of how much content and what kind of content you post on social media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3. Engagement Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These metrics are usually the first metrics that business owners consider when evaluating the performance of their social media advertising efforts.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, this shouldn\u2019t be because \u201cwho your audience is\u201d and \u201cwhat your audience would engage with\u201d should be of top priority.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Except if your primary goal of running social media advertising is to generate likes and comments, the engagement metric should be your prime target.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, this is always the easiest metric to track as you can easily see under your posts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Engagement metrics include:\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Total engagements<\/li>\r\n<li># of individual engagements by type \u2013 likes, comments, shares, link click, retweets, etc.<\/li>\r\n<li>Engagement rate \u2013 percentage increase or decrease<\/li>\r\n<li># of mentions received<\/li>\r\n<li># of direct messages received<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As stated above, you can quickly determine your engagement metric in the frontend underneath your post. You can also find your engagement metrics in the social media page insights, especially for link click.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, as a professional digital marketer, I would recommend using social media scheduling tools, such as Agorapulse, Sprout Social, or Hootsuite. They are not only professional but also easier to use.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4. Conversion Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing you shouldn\u2019t forget to track is your conversion metric. The audience may engage well with your social content but what is the effectiveness of this social engagement?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tracking conversion metrics will enable you to determine the effectiveness of your social engagement. Some of the conversion metrics to track are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The conversion rate: this is the number of audiences that eventually got converted after reading your content, taking an action, or clicking on a link in your post against the total number of audience that visited your page.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, a user may find your posts interesting, likes it and even add a comment, but never take any further action like accepting your offer, making a purchase, downloading any content, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A high conversion rate means the engagement generated by your content is valuable and effective at compelling your target audience. A high conversion rate is evidence that your content was relevant to your offer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To be able to track your conversion metrics, you must ensure that all of your content has a clear CTA link. You can use a URL shortener for your link to make it trackable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Use tools like Social media insights, and other campaign reporting tools to track the total number of clicks and conversions generated by your content.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Note that conversion rate is independent of traffic rate i.e. you may have low traffic to your page and yet get a high conversion rate for your content.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/wDAav7r-nR5bx9DsQINK9CW3JfgxIipvlB9_aMhd78WED7Rof1OtztAA53lBcdvwiv4dBv5Kjm7M4qgjxLFHZ1XlDevZInEdX_LkC3VlBZ9kzkE7b00cmVGuQllhnbM7pofKV-iG\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\total-conversions-social-media-metrics-1024x622.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5. Listening Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Engagement from your target audience is not enough as you need to listen to what is involved in their engagement.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You need to dig deeper and listen to what your audience is saying and commenting about your business on social media. You can use these conversations for sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, or negative).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By monitoring the conversations from engagements and analyzing them, you would be able to determine how to respond to your audience, address customers\u2019 issues, give praise when needed, and solve any issues that may arise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/S-MPDFFUEskmUm3nOo-OC4xrakNnnhC_fn1aXGwZW7lRBdaG-MBvPxBlKQnILCLXWEW5SV2QBoheKIGLTMD6vdA1q-NLwHedzYE0tCVV9xAg9FcltsJ0KA8oMf7hIoInsNXyjqWo\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\bad-review-7.jpg\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Listening metrics include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li># of Brand Mentions<\/li>\r\n<li># of Positive Sentiments<\/li>\r\n<li># of Neutral Sentiments\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<li># of Negative Sentiments<\/li>\r\n<li>Primary Mentioner<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To track listening metrics on social media, here are some best tools to consider:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandwatch.com\/\">Brandwatch<\/a>\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">SEMrush<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweetdeck.twitter.com\/\">TweetDeck<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although these tools make listening metrics easier, you can also listen to engagement manually to keep up with the conversation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6. Social Traffic Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This metric is very important to you if your main reason for running a social media advertising campaign is to generate traffic to your website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When the audience sees your post or content, you want them to take some certain actions through the CTA that would impact your website, product pages.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So you need to track what happens when an audience clicks on the CTA or link and heads to your landing page or website.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social traffic metrics would help you to know your bounce rate for social traffic. For instance, are your audience leaving your website immediately and returning to the social media platform?\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That means your web content is possibly different from what you posted on social media or not properly aligned with it and you need to make some adjustments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Or are your visitors taking the right actions you wanted them to take? These are what tracking the social media metric would help you to determine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social traffic metrics include:\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Number of links shared on social media<\/li>\r\n<li>Total sessions<\/li>\r\n<li>Pages per session<\/li>\r\n<li>Total page views<\/li>\r\n<li>Average session duration\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<li>Bounce rate<\/li>\r\n<li>Mobile vs. Desktop traffic<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tools for tracking social traffic metrics include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Google Analytics<\/li>\r\n<li>SEMrush<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/RyT10740uSTDIkD5m8Y9yeeSGNMYfmpuXDL8afizpFvT5JPewCTqHqH7Gm4915Sl0hF_LWrrMCK7enhGnQt1-9T_22w1dCcqf75GyetofgyLdQoPLU0shcFN5OcgSwok-n_avjCp\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\social-media-metrics-traffic-google-analytics-600.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7. Competitor Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You\u2019re not the only one within your industry to use social media advertising. Your competitors as well are using the strategy to grow their business.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, tracking what your competitors are doing on social media can help you to better manage and benefit more from your social media marketing strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although tracking competitor metrics wouldn\u2019t let you know how successful your competitors\u2019 social media advertising efforts are contributing to their business success or how it will contribute to your business success.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Business owners can use the data generated from the metric to make smart decisions and generate new tactics, strategies, and ideas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Competitor metrics include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>% of Engagement Difference<\/li>\r\n<li>Competitor Strengths<\/li>\r\n<li>Competitor Weaknesses<\/li>\r\n<li>New Opportunities<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To track competitor metrics, you need to follow your competitors\u2019 accounts on social media. This will enable you to view their ads, posts, and content just as other users do.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You also need to take note of what type of content your competitors are sharing on social media and if they\u2019re making use of influencers or not.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some potent tools you can use for competitor metrics include BuzzSumo, SEMrush, <a href=\"https:\/\/phlanx.com\/\">Phlanx<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/likealyzer.com\/\">Likealyzer<\/a>.

Branding Metrics<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from seeing how your audience engages with your posts and content, you need to ensure that all of your posts and content align with your business. After all, you wouldn\u2019t post content that is irrelevant to your business brand.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The essence of tracking your branding metrics is to evaluate how well your posts and content on social media align with your business.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are your posts clear and consistent with your brand\u2019s voice? Do your image posts have a similar feel to your brand? Can your target audience see any connection between your posts to your brand name?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for you to outlines some important branding specifications when curating your social content, such as:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Basic do\u2019s and don\u2019ts<\/li>\r\n<li>Business naming, including abbreviation and capitalization policy<\/li>\r\n<li>Mission statement to follow<\/li>\r\n<li>Public relations policies<\/li>\r\n<li>Terminology to use or avoid<\/li>\r\n<li>Visual marketing guidelines<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some branding metrics to track:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do all social posts and content match or follow your brand guidelines? Y\/N<\/li>\r\n<li>Do you need to make any changes to branding? Y\/N<\/li>\r\n<li>Do your posts or comments reflect these changes? Y\/N<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More so, you need to evaluate your branding on social media to ensure consistency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, if you\u2019ve posted earlier using an abbreviation for your business name instead of the full business name, make sure that your subsequent posts bear the abbreviation of your business name.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, you need to address the issue of inconsistency. Remember social users are so swift to notice any changes to your brand\u2019s style.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/IEL8nZqBl0GzI-zufgJayvUondtlDJn3HvW4tG6U15aPHOrexuhD2Il8CpcwwKZtpFJAlC4nQcdVV0zifjCFLSiBdt_Pxg9XxAVNNygOxKwxYBTUTOlZL-VD6aDSGgKfkO1JOvhu\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\social-media-metrics-tools-semrush-600.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>9.

For instance, you can set a dollar value for each conversion.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you know the source of each conversion (<em>from audience metrics above<\/em>), you can easily calculate the revenue generated by this source.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/014sxgz6po96HcwG4qcNsiHGgEoyu31zZh_N8v1Wiln5qQ1qqTTyXa-KZFZ7G7dKd0_dVl1OrzG3jLMrGRLRYYrjBMDLTX7PImuaR9yRgOnXH6HM2GZI35KSOxvoJMx1tDKI5z_0\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\Apostle Tim\\Downloads\\revenue-social-media-metrics-1024x585.png\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you run an eCommerce website or another website that sells products, you would understand that conversions mean sales.
