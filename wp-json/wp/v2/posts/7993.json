A full-fledged marketing company that not only supports its employees, serves as a safe space for creativity &amp; individuality but also supports causes that mean something to each of us &#8211; and so many people around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>The Cause<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The cause I am most passionate about is Room to Grow, an organization that supports families during the most critical part of a child&#8217;s life. Room to Grow is a place of future hope. They not only provide immediately needed resources (clothing, bottles, toys\u2026) but the ultimate goal is to set the parents up with resources. These resources lead to connections, and a future for them and their families. From interview techniques to baby clothes, work attire to books &#8211; Room to Grow doesn\u2019t stop at donations. Room to Grow\u2019s program combines three proven forms of family support: personalized parent coaching, free baby items, and connections to community resources.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This isn\u2019t simply a handout, it\u2019s a way to guarantee a better life for baby + family.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>My Story<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My mom is the reason I strive to bring awareness to community programs such as Room to Grow. As a teen mom, she wasn\u2019t given the resources or community network that allowed her to create the life she wanted for both herself and me. With a program like Room to Grow, she would have been given the tools to educate herself both in the world of parenting &amp; her desired career. If it wasn\u2019t for family, I do not know where we would be today. Unfortunately, most families in our situation, those living in poverty, or those without a community &#8211; end up falling into various statistics.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Children deserve opportunities. Mothers &amp; Fathers deserve resources. By supporting programs such as Room to Grow, we together can make that happen.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Personally, I have had my hand in the Boston location for years. From donations to volunteer work, I have had the privilege of serving my community alongside my mother, truly showing the value of networking and what the \u201cfull-circle\u201d can do for a family.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re interested in learning more, donating items or financially, or volunteering your time, please visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/roomtogrow.org\/\"><span class=\"s2\">roomtogrow.org<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7995\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Room-to-Grow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"152\" height=\"158\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Kayla and I am an Account Manager at Socialistics.
