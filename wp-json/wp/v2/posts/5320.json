Every month we donate $250 and promote these organizations in our commitment to making a difference.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Aubrey and I am a Social Media Manager at Socialistics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The holiday season offers all of us the chance to give back and support the causes we care about most. In a year that has been unsettling for so many, I am honored to advocate for the work at Make-A-Wish.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1980, Make-A-Wish has granted hundreds of thousands of life-changing wishes to children battling critical illnesses. Research shows that children tend to have the physical and emotional strength needed to fight their critical illness when they have their wishes granted. These wishes have the power to give families hope during dark times, strength to persevere, and experiences that forever change their lives.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to COVID-19, roughly 30 wishes a day have been postponed and there will be more wish-kids waiting for wishes than ever before.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I had the honor to speak with Jeannette Tarcha, Vice President of Communications and Marketing at Make-A-Wish Alaska and Washington, and this is what she had to say about the impact COVID has had on them:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>\u201cFundraising is not keeping pace as we are seeing wish requests climb, month over month, for wishes that simply put: cost more money. For example, we\u2019ve seen a boom in object-related wishes (like camper trailers) or for home improvement (like she-sheds, pool renovations, room makeovers)&#8230;. we can\u2019t afford to grant all these wish requests in real time and our wish waiting list is growing. We are scheduling out wishes because we don\u2019t have the money and resources to grant them now. Your support is needed today so we can grant as many of these wishes as possible, as quickly as we can right now and when the pandemic is over.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Please join us in supporting the Make-A-Wish Foundation this season. As we all know, the imagination of a child can take them anywhere. You can help these children rediscover their imaginations with wishes that will give them the confidence, joy, and hope to keep fighting.
