I personally grew up in a single parent family with my mom and brother, and there were no shortages of challenges we had as a family. Despite those challenges, I was fortunate to not have to deal with any sort of domestic violence, but so many are not so lucky. It breaks my heart to even think about a woman, child or anyone in a position of being abused or without a safe place to stay. It is for this reason that I have decided to highlight the <a href=\"https:\/\/dvs-snoco.org\/\">Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>DVS is a private, non-profit organization serving Snohomish County in Washington state since 1976. They are the only program in Snohomish County providing emergency shelter and comprehensive, confidential services to victims of domestic abuse without regard to age, gender, race, religion, culture, national origin, sexual orientation or income level. DVS provides individual and community awareness programs which can affect the social change necessary to eliminate domestic violence throughout Snohomish County.<\/p>\n<p>Please join me and Socialistics in creating awareness and providing support for this tremendous organization that has and is making a big difference in providing support for those in need that are victims of domestic abuse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/dvs-snoco.org\/donate\/' class='big-button bigblue'>Donate to DCS Today<\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Socialistics Cares is our monthly campaign highlighting organizations that our team is passionate about making a difference with.
