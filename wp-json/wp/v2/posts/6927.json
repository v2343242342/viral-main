It\u2019s not always easy, though.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have you been thinking about hiring someone to help you run your social media accounts and manage your campaigns? Instead of hiring one social media manager to do all of that work, why not partner with an agency that employs a full team of experienced social media experts?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Outlined below are some of the top benefits you can experience when you hire a social media agency rather than just hiring one full-time employee to manage all of your social media marketing needs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Reduced Cost<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At first, many business owners assume that it costs more money to hire a social media agency than it does to just employ one person. The opposite is actually true, though.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our research, we\u2019ve found that the average full-time social media manager earns about $4,500 per month.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to paying them that salary, which adds up to $54,000 per year, there are a lot of other expenses associated with a full-time employee. This includes various taxes, benefits, insurance premiums, 401(k) contributions, and paid vacations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019ll also have to spend money setting up a place for your new employee to work. You\u2019ll likely have to invest in software programs or other subscriptions to help them do their job, too. All of that adds up to a little less than $61,000 per year for one employee.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the monthly retainer that an agency like Socialistics charges is just $3,000. That adds up to $36,000 per year, a little more than half of what you\u2019d spend on an employee.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Think of what you could do with all of that extra money. What else could you invest in to grow your business and make it even more profitable?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a chart breaking down the average cost of a full-time employee compared to the cost of hiring an agency:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/mlkmqsz262vk.i.optimole.com\/0WKpAqc-JWbGEwBZ\/w:1170\/h:1074\/q:75\/https:\/\/www.socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-4.05.26-PM.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Expanded Capacity<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The cost savings alone are enough for most people to get serious about hiring an agency instead of an individual employee. If you need some more convincing, though, think about the expanded capacity that an agency has compared to a full-time social media manager.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A whole team of social media experts will always be able to do more for your brand than one individual. Not only can they get more done, but they can, as a collective, bring a greater level of depth to your projects than one person can by themselves.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Access to the Latest Technologies<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media agencies often have access to the latest social media marketing tools and technologies. It\u2019s far easier for a full team to keep up with the ever-changing social media landscape than it for one employee who\u2019s already bogged down with dozens of other tasks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Access to Measurable Results<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you partner with an agency, you not only have access to more advanced tools and technologies, but these tools and technologies can also provide you with more detailed information about how your campaigns are doing. This, in turn, makes it easier for you to figure out what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media agencies take much of the guesswork out of the equation. They help you to make informed decisions about how you run your business and market your brand.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Faster Turnaround Times<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One social media manager for your business can only work so quickly. It doesn\u2019t matter how efficient they are or how skilled they are at their job. At the end of the day, they\u2019re just one person.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A social media agency, with its larger staff and expanded resources, will be able to get more done in less time. This means you\u2019ll be able to launch campaigns and start seeing results sooner. All of this will lead to an expanded reach, more engagement, and more conversions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Less Risk<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are tons of risks associated with hiring a new employee. First of all, there are expenses associated with advertising and filling an open position. Then, there are the risks that you face when someone joins your team.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how great a person seems in an interview, there\u2019s still a possibility that they won\u2019t mesh well with the rest of your staff. There\u2019s also a chance, of course, that they won\u2019t be as good at helping you build up your social media presence as they claimed to be. You\u2019ll never know until you bring them on full-time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, if you find that they\u2019re not a good fit, you\u2019re left with two less-than-ideal options: Keep paying them and hope they get better, or fire them and spend more money trying to find a replacement. All the while, your business\u2019s social media marketing strategy suffers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Less Stress<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, hiring a social media agency is far less stressful than hiring a social media manager. Think about all of the time that you have to spend recruiting, interviewing, and then training someone so that they can accurately represent your brand online.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the idea of doing all of that makes your stomach turn, you\u2019re likely better off partnering with an agency instead.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take anywhere near as much time or energy to meet with an agency rep and figure out whether or not you get along well with them and like their work. The best agencies also will have lots of reviews and testimonials that you can reference to determine whether or not they\u2019re a good fit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Work with a Social Media Agency Today<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why you ought to hire a social media agency to handle all of your social media marketing needs. An agency can do far more for your brand than one individual employee can, from reducing costs to producing more noticeable and measurable results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Do you want to partner with a high-performing agency today?
