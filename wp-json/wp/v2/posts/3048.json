Businesses spend thousands of dollars optimizing their website\u2019s SEO to rank well on Google &#8211; what people don\u2019t realize is a lot of the same principles apply on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve put together some \u201cquick wins\u201d you can apply to your LinkedIn profile to dramatically improve your discoverability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Add a \u201ccall-to-action\u201d to your LinkedIn Headline<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one might be controversial (and, frankly, can go <em>very wrong<\/em>) but one of the best things you can do to increase your discoverability from your target audience (whether that\u2019s job seekers, potential employers, business partners, or customers) is to include a CTA in your headline. Consider the following headline:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cSoftware Engineer @ Company\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a pretty standard headline &#8211; but, let\u2019s say you\u2019re job hunting, the only people it\u2019s going to attract are desperate recruiters. You\u2019re not going to catch the eye of a direct hiring manager, fellow engineers at your target companies, or any other leads that can you in. Why?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn\u2019t express your need. There\u2019s no immediate clarity that you\u2019re even available.<\/li>\n<li>Outside of what\u2019s encapsulated in the profession (\u201csoftware engineer\u201d) there\u2019s no detail in the value you provide.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Unless you have an extremely specific\/niche job title, this headline will do little to attract potential employers. Instead, consider something like this:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cSoftware Eng @ Company. Need help with DevOps?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This headline accomplishes a few things. For one thing, it makes it clear what your skillset &amp; specialization is\u00a0 &#8211; companies rarely hire a generic \u201csoftware engineer\u201d (substitute that for \u201cwriter\u201d, \u201cmarketer\u201d, \u201caccount executive\u201d, etc). The reflection of personal specialization immediately makes you stand out to people <em>who are looking for that specialization<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The other thing this line accomplishes is that it makes it clear you\u2019re available for work, despite not being explicit (which is good for your current company!). It keeps the door open that you\u2019re available for a conversation about where you can help a company out.<\/p>\n<p>(The same concept applied towards business owners: \u201cCEO @ BurgersNow\u201d vs \u201cCEO @ BurgersNow. Need to feed your employees?\u201d)<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Have a good profile photo<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Alright, you knew this was coming.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the most generic LinkedIn profile advice, yet go and comb your feed and you\u2019ll see a never-ending swarm of people <em>who don\u2019t follow it<\/em>. Cartoon images, awkward selfies, or no photo at all are surprisingly common.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, having a photo <em>alone<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/expandedramblings.com\/index.php\/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats\/\">will get you<\/a> <strong>21x more profile views<\/strong> and <strong>36x more messages<\/strong>. A photo alone could make the difference between getting your dream job and not &#8211; kind of crazy, right?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a photo that actually looks like you.<\/strong> Much like online dating, the last thing you want is to show up to a job interview and they don\u2019t recognize you. Sure, it doesn\u2019t have quite the same impact as with dating but it immediately erodes trust in you before you\u2019ve even opened your mouth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be as professional as you need to be. <\/strong>Your profile picture should calibrate to your industry. Interested in breaking into professional services? Suit &amp; tie are a must. Rather looking to move into a tech startup? A suit &amp; tie will reflect negatively on you &#8211; instead, use a simple, well-lit image in casual wear.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your cover photo is your secret weapon. <\/strong>Use the cover photo as an opportunity to show more about your personality to enforce culture fit. You could, for instance, use it to display you performing a hobby that you\u2019d want prospective employers or partners to know about.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Most of the people viewing your profile make a decision about you in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologicalscience.org\/index.php\/publications\/observer\/2006\/july-06\/how-many-seconds-to-a-first-impression.html\"><strong>tenth of a second<\/strong><\/a> &#8211; make that decision a good one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Don\u2019t make overly long summaries<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you seen those profile pages with extremely long-winded, overly-descriptive summaries? Summaries that go into every element of the individual\u2019s professional life (even, often, veering into the personal)? Those summaries will at worst reflect negatively on you as being narcissistic and will at best be ignored completely.<\/p>\n<p>As we mentioned before, it\u2019s a matter of seconds before a prospective contact decides on your value to them &#8211; don\u2019t waste it on a wall of text. <strong>Get to the point.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Keep your summary short &#8211; 1 or 2 paragraphs which cover the following points: what you do, what you\u2019re good at, what you\u2019re looking for. Be subtle around the latter point if you\u2019re currently employed and not wanting to burn bridges (use our earlier suggestion of \u201cWant to chat PPC marketing? My email is <a href=\"mailto:xx@yy.com\">xx@yy.com<\/a>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Oh yeah: leave your email. The less friction you introduce to contacting you, the more likely people will do it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Skills, skills, skills<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although the age-old \u201cyou endorse me I endorse you cycle\u201d can seem never-ending, tiring &amp; pointless, it actually has a purpose: skills are the <strong>single best way to show up in targeted LinkedIn searches<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Which means, the more of your skills you flesh out, the more likely you are to have your profile visited by people who are looking to connect with people like you.<\/p>\n<p>People with 5+ skills see <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.linkedin.com\/2018\/january\/9\/tuesday-tip-stand-out-by-flexing-your-skills-on-your-linkedin-profile\">17 times<\/a> more profile views than average. Focus on a mix of skills &#8211; not just your core technical ones, but soft skills as well. They\u2019re particularly important if you\u2019re looking to cross the chasm in your career and move into management.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Keyword density<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, a lot of the old techniques that were used to rank on Google can now be used to rank on LinkedIn. The biggest one is keyword density &#8211; simply put, the more core keywords you have lingering around your profile, the more likely you are to show up on different search engines (both internally, and elsewhere).<\/p>\n<p>Keyword density alone can help achieve over a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/increase-linkedin-profile-views\">25% increase in LinkedIn profile<\/a> views and they\u2019re extremely easy to do &#8211; in fact, you\u2019ve already started doing them if you followed tip number 1. Figure out the main keywords that outline who you are and what you bring to the table, and double down on those.<\/p>\n<p>Another important tip to keep in mind here is to <strong>normalize the keywords<\/strong>. What I mean by that is, big keywords and try to latch on to them. For example, instead of \u201cDirector of Partnerships\u201d consider something like \u201cMarketing Director (Partnerships)\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll show up on a lot more searches that way &#8211; and the important thing is to do it in a way that it\u2019s not disingenuous. In this example, a \u201cDirector of Partnerships\u201d would still be relevant to someone searching for a \u201cMarketing Director\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s it! If you implement just a few of these techniques, you\u2019re guaranteed to see an upswing in your profile views. The rest comes down to putting yourself out there more, creating more content, adding value to your existing network and leveraging that to branch out.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Did you know we are recognized as a top Ad Agency\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designrush.com\/agency\/ad-agencies\">DesignRush<\/a>?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LinkedIn is a mixed bag.
