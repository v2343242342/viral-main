Every month we will be donating $250 and showcasing an organization that someone that works at Socialistics cares about deeply to create awareness around. Generosity is one of our core values, and it is important that we take the time out of our busy lives to recognize that there are others in great need.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Joanna and I am the Director of Paid Media at Socialistics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I love the work I do with Socialistics. I have been working here since November of 2019, and have felt freedom in my work that I hadn\u2019t experienced before. At its core, Socialistics is a safe place to share ideas, support each other, and work with some of the most generous and kind people the world has to offer. As a company, we strongly believe in being generous. With each other. With our clients. And now with the causes that matter the most to us.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The cause I am most passionate about is mental health and suicide prevention. My charity of choice is the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My dad is the reason I fight to raise awareness of mental health and suicide prevention. He was a gentle soul, sensitive to the needs of others, loving and selfless. He loved to listen and learn of others\u2019 experiences and travels. In March of 2020, my dad died by suicide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After months of what felt like living in slow motion, I ached to do something. I want to make a difference. I found AFSP (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) and discovered a plethora of resources on coping with loss, preventing suicide and advocating for awareness. I will also be volunteering with a US-based crisis center that provides support to those in immediate need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to help but are not sure where to start, start by knowing this: <strong>suicide is preventable<\/strong>. Use the resources provided by the AFSP to educate yourself on suicide. Know the warning signs. Know the resources that are available to you in your community. Lastly, donate to the cause. You can donate here: <a href=\"https:\/\/afsp.donordrive.com\/\">https:\/\/afsp.donordrive.com\/<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-5292\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/image-933x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"394\" height=\"431\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, know you\u2019re not alone and help is out there.
