Are you posting at least this often on Facebook and other social media platforms? Have you been wondering how often you should post on social media?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of factors to consider when deciding how often to post online. Listed below are some of the most important things to keep in mind when creating or fine-tuning your brand\u2019s social media marketing strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-5338\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Picture1.png\" alt=\"How Often Should You Post On Social Media\" width=\"733\" height=\"475\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/hs-fs\/hubfs\/social-media-publishing-frequency.jpg?width=1200&amp;name=social-media-publishing-frequency.jpg\">Image source<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Consistency Trumps Frequency<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a general rule, your posting consistency is more important than your posting frequency. In other words, it\u2019s more important to post on a regular basis &#8212; even if that means only posting a few times per week &#8212; than it is to have one week when you post three times per day and then two weeks in a row when you don\u2019t post at all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you post consistently, your audience will be more likely to see your content in their feeds. They\u2019ll also pick up on your posting schedule and will develop a greater sense of confidence in you and your dependability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your audience will also likely be more inclined to share your content when you post regularly. This, in turn, helps you to expand your reach and get in front of new potential followers. As your audience grows, your engagement and revenues increase, too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Tips for Posting More Consistently<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling with consistency, here are some tips that will help you to make social media posting a regular part of your marketing strategy:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Set a realistic goal<\/strong>: Don\u2019t try to go from posting once a week to posting seven days per week overnight. Set a goal that you are confident you can reach, then increase from there if you want to try posting more<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Plan content ahead of time<\/strong>: When you plan ahead, you won\u2019t be posting just for the sake of posting, and you\u2019ll feel confident that you\u2019re sharing content that is actually valuable to your audience<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Create content in batches<\/strong>: Sit down and create several posts at once; that way, you\u2019ll have everything ready to go and will know exactly what to post and when<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Automate your posts<\/strong>: Consider using a social media posting tool; this automates your posting schedule so you can publish posts on several platforms all at once, without having to dedicate a ton of time to it<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Quality Is Better Than Quantity<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The quality of your content matters more than the quantity of posts you publish each week.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can follow every arbitrary posting rule out there (such as, \u201cpost every Tuesday at 1 pm for maximum results\u201d). However, if you\u2019re posting low-quality content that isn\u2019t relevant to your audience, you\u2019re not going to see the kind of engagement and outcomes you\u2019re hoping for.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s especially important to note that for brands with smaller followings, in particular, posting more often will not necessarily result in more clicks and engagement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Research from Hubspot shows that Facebook pages that have over 10,000 followers are the only ones that notice an increase in clicks when they post more often (between 31 and 60 times per month). The same research also revealed that smaller pages (fewer than 10,000 followers) received fewer clicks when they increased their post frequency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-5339\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Picture2.png\" alt=\"How Often Should You Post On Social Media\" width=\"733\" height=\"302\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/hs-fs\/hub\/53\/file-2430699843-png\/00-Blog-Related_Images\/FB_posts.png?width=1338&amp;name=FB_posts.png\">Image source<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, overwhelming your followers with low-quality posts will not help you build your brand. You\u2019re better off focusing on creating high-quality, relevant, and highly targeted posts instead.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Improve Post Quality<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How do you make sure you\u2019re publishing high-quality posts on social media? Here are some tips that can help:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get to know your audience<\/strong>: Who are you trying to reach with your post? What interests them? What kind of language or images will appeal most to them?<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Make your posts personal<\/strong>: Your followers want to know who\u2019s behind the brand. If you\u2019re overly formal with your post, it might be harder to create strong audience connections<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t be too salesy<\/strong>: Avoid overly salesy language, too; people don\u2019t want to feel as though they\u2019re always having something pushed on them<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Improve your design skills<\/strong>: You\u2019ll see better results if your posts feature high-quality, attractive images, clear videos, and colors that align with your brand\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Let Your Goals Fuel Your Strategy<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to take your social media marketing strategy to the next level, you need to set clear goals and objectives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before you start posting more often online, take some time to figure out what you want to see after you increase your posting frequency. Then, let your goals and objectives fuel your strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What kinds of goals might you set for your social media strategy? The following are some of the most common goals brands tend to set for themselves:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Increase brand awareness<\/li>\r\n<li>Generate more leads<\/li>\r\n<li>Increase social media engagement<\/li>\r\n<li>Increase website traffic<\/li>\r\n<li>Sell more products or services<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you set clear goals, it\u2019s easier for you to tell if your strategy is working. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in increasing website traffic.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you increase your posting frequency but don\u2019t see an increase in web traffic, you haven\u2019t met your goal, which means you\u2019ll need to go back to the drawing board and figure out what\u2019s stopping people from clicking on your links and navigating back to your website.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Tips for Setting Social Media Goals<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not sure what kinds of goals to set for your social media platforms? These tips can help:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Conduct a social media audit<\/strong>: An audit from a professional helps you figure out what\u2019s working with your social media platforms and what isn\u2019t. After an audit, you might find that your post frequency isn\u2019t the problem at all<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Decide what matters<\/strong>: What will benefit your business most? More website traffic? A better online reputation? More conversions?<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Make your goals measurable<\/strong>: If you want to create a strategy that helps you to accomplish your goals, start by fine-tuning your goals so they are realistic and provide you with measurable data (clicks, shares, page views, etc.)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Investment is Essential<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that some kind of investment is essential if you want to see results from your social media strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These days, with so many brands using social media for marketing purposes, organic reach is practically non-existent. You could be posting all day, every day. However, if you\u2019re not investing in paid social ads, you\u2019re going to have a hard time seeing measurable improvements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you invest in paid social media ads, it\u2019s easier to target specific people with your posts. This allows you to fine-tune your ads and posts so that you reach the people who are most likely to check out your website and buy what you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Best Types of Paid Social Media Ads<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure which kinds of paid social media ads to invest in, here are some ideas to help you get started:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Facebook Ads<\/strong>: These ads are great for building brand awareness (Facebook is the <a href=\"https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/rise-of-social-media#:~:text=With%202.3%20billion%20users%2C%20Facebook,over%20half%20a%20billion%20users.\">most popular<\/a> social media platform, after all), generating leads, and increasing conversions<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Instagram Ads<\/strong>: Since Facebook owns Instagram, advertising on this platform can also help you to build awareness, generate leads, and increase conversions<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Twitter Ads<\/strong>: Twitter ads are also effective for building brand awareness; they can increase website views and overall engagement, too<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>LinkedIn Ads<\/strong>: LinkedIn ads are very effective for B2B companies looking to build awareness among professionals in their industry and related industries<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Bonus Tips for Better Social Media Results<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s definitely not easy to figure out how frequently you need to post on social media. Consider all the factors listed above when you\u2019re making plans for your brand. Don\u2019t forget these bonus tips, too:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Look at Your Analytics<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Assess your post analytics for different social media platforms. This will help you get a better sense of when your audience is paying the most attention to your posts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Are there certain days when people are more likely to click on links or engage with your posts? If so, keep that information in mind so you can tailor your posting schedule accordingly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Work with an Agency<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A social media agency can help with the heavy lifting when it comes to fine-tuning your social media posts and figuring out the best days and times to post. If you\u2019re feeling lost and don\u2019t know where to start when it comes to changing up your strategy, investing in an agency\u2019s assistance is a great option.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Be Patient<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, be patient. It will take time before you see results from making changes to your strategy. If you\u2019re consistent and patient, though, you\u2019ll start to achieve your social media goals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Improve Your Social Media Strategy Today<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the answer to the question \u201chow often should you post on social media?\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a simple one. If you keep these tips in mind, though, you\u2019ll have an easier time figuring out a posting schedule that works for you and helps you see results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Do you need additional help managing your brand\u2019s social media profiles?
