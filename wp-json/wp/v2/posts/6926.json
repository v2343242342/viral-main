Are you unsure of how to make this happen?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of hiring a social media manager or trying to handle everything on your own, consider working with a social media agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t know what a social media agency can do that you (or another full-time employee) can\u2019t? Read on to find out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Provide Access to More Resources<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re working with a tight budget, you probably can\u2019t afford new social media management software or tools that streamline the posting and content creation process.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media agencies have access to all of these resources and more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you partner with a professional agency, you can rest easy. You\u2019ll feel confident knowing they\u2019ve already invested in the best tools (and have learned how to use them in ways that ensure you get noticed).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Save Money on New Employees<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You <em>could<\/em> hire a social media manager to improve your social media image and market your brand. However, taking this approach could also cost you a lot of money.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, you might assume that <a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/social-media-agency-vs-hiring-an-employee\/\">working with an agency<\/a> is a more expensive option. In reality, though, it\u2019s way more costly to hire a full-time employee than it is to pay a flat monthly fee to an agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On average, it costs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/about-shrm\/press-room\/press-releases\/pages\/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx\">$4,129<\/a> to hire a new employee. It also takes, on average, 42 days to fill an open position. If that doesn\u2019t sound appealing (or cost-effective) to you, an agency is the better choice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep Up with Social Media Trends<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2016\/12\/social-media-marketing-statistics.html#:~:text=GENERAL%20SOCIAL%20MEDIA%20MARKETING%20STATISTICS%3A&amp;text=44%20percent%20of%20local%20businesses,on%20it%20to%20drive%20revenue.&amp;text=More%20than%2050%20percent%20of,years%20have%20reported%20improved%20sales.\">44 percent<\/a> of small businesses report that they depend on social media for generating brand awareness. Forty-one percent also say that they depend on it to drive revenue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If these statistics resonate with you, you must keep up with social media trends to continue seeing results. This can be hard to do when you\u2019re busy running and building a company, though.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A social media agency will do all the research and heavy lifting for you. That way, you\u2019re free to focus on other important matters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Offer Expertise in the Field<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social media management is far more difficult than most people realize.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You might assume at first that it\u2019s just about throwing up a post every once in a while. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that, though.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>From posting at the most appropriate times to creating content that your audience enjoys, social media management is a full-time job.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you work with an agency, you get access to genuine experts. They will provide valuable insight, assess your current analytics, and help you create a strategy that produces great long-term results.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Are You Ready to Work with a Social Media Agency?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there are lots of advantages that a social media agency can provide. Are you ready to experience these benefits? If so, it\u2019s time to start working with an agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> today at Socialistics to learn more about our social media services.
