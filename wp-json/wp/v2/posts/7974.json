This notification appears over results that this applies to. It\u2019s basically saying anyone who is viewing and acting on the ads on iOS 14 and has opted out of tracking is not included in the results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the issue is two-fold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that those who have opted out of tracking on iOS 14 will not have their interests \u2018tracked\u2019. So, advertisers are no longer able to use interest targeting and include users who have opted out. <\/span><b>Audience sizes will decrease. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, the extent of which is yet to be determined.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who have opted out of tracking on iOS 14 will also not be included in the results in ads manager. If the above described users sees an ad for a product, goes to the website, and purchases the product, the advertiser will not see this in Ads Manager.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Who will the iOS privacy update affect?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, this affects anyone who advertises on social media platforms, but let\u2019s get into the nitty gritty. Businesses who depend on social media ads for revenue will be hit the hardest. We\u2019re looking at you, e-commerce and app download campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses who branch out in social media ads and use the reach, brand awareness, website traffic and engagement objectives will likely notice these changes far less? Why? While all cost per results are subject to shoot up due to these changes, the effects that the aforementioned objectives have will remain similar.\u00a0 You will still get your message out, you\u2019ll still get engagement on your posts or traffic to your website, the cost may rise, but the activity is still there. Targeting niche audiences will be more difficult, but at the brand awareness level, advertisers typically are not targeting niche audiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With conversion campaigns, it gets a little dicier. A metric commonly used to assess the performance of these campaigns is ROAS (return on ad spend). If the cost per conversion increases due to lack of tracking, the ROAS decreases and the efficiency of the campaign can diminish significantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see below a current (May 7, 2021) screenshot of Facebook Ads Manager. Have a look at the different campaigns: Post Engagements, Website Leads, Reach. For website leads, which requires website pixel tracking, has the notification discussed above. For post engagements and reach, there is no indication from Facebook that these results will be significantly affected by this iOS update.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7977 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.17.58@2x.png\" alt=\"fb ads\" width=\"1270\" height=\"818\" srcset=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.17.58@2x.png 1270w, https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.17.58@2x-980x631.png 980w, https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.17.58@2x-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1270px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7978\" src=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.18.09@2x.png\" alt=\"ios privacy update\" width=\"1296\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.18.09@2x.png 1296w, https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.18.09@2x-1280x401.png 1280w, https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.18.09@2x-980x307.png 980w, https:\/\/socialistics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-12-at-13.18.09@2x-480x150.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1296px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>So what should we consider doing?<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excel in other areas. So ultra-specific targeting may be a thing of the past, but not all hope is lost. Strive for greatness when it comes to your ads creative and copy. Don\u2019t skimp on design, strategy and copy when it comes to your ads. Consult with a social media agency if you don\u2019t have these capabilities currently.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to Facebook. There are several things Facebook is recommending businesses do to prepare for these changes. These include verifying your domain, checking your audience sizes, and switching to aggregated event measurement, and checking which conversion events may be limited by the new tracking. Ticking all of these boxes will ensure your campaigns are as optimized as possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about your target audience in other ways. Who is subscribing to your newsletter? If you have a list of names and e-mail addresses, you can upload this to Facebook and create a custom audience with which to target. Also, running surveys to learn more about who is purchasing your products or services can help you narrow down who to target on Facebook.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branch out onto different platforms. While you may see your cost per result increase across all social media platforms due to these changes, now is the time to go where your audience is! Are they on Pinterest? Twitter? TikTok? Instagram? Facebook? Snapchat? Be on the right platform\/s and reduce ad spend waste.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in influencer marketing. Influencers have been around for several years now and their role now could not be more valuable. Businesses that are finding success with this are adept at selecting influencers that have audiences who are likely to be interested in their product. It\u2019s like manual audience selection (thanks for trying, Facebook, but we got this).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><b>What do you think is going to happen now?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Apple is making it easy for users to opt-out of tracking (and the data above suggests many users are), it\u2019s still early!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What many users don\u2019t understand (yet) is that they have just opted-out of a customized scrolling experience. This does not mean these platforms are now ad-free. They will still get delivered an equal amount of ads as before, but now the ads they see may not be relevant to them at all. While we may see a spike in users opting-out, we could see that dip right back down when users realize they prefer a custom experience.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook will continue to fight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide a personalized experience for users and maintaining a free platform. Apple is no angel of privacy, here. Apple\u2019s own ad platform is not subject to the new iOS privacy update policy. Convenient, hey! As time rolls on and the consequences are felt deeply by businesses around the world, we believe that we\u2019ll see some modifications to this policy.
